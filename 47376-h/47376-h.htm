</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Antonio</span> was young, handsome,
and a gondolier. He
lacked but two things; a gondola
of his own, and an
Englishman. He was too
poor to buy a gondola, and
though he occasionally hired an old and
extremely dilapidated one, and trusted to his
handsome face to enable him to capture a
party of foreign ladies, his profits had to be
divided with the owner of the gondola, and
were thus painfully small. The <i>traghetto</i>
brought him in a few francs per month, and
he picked up other small sums by serving as
second oar, whenever tourists could be convinced
that a second oar was necessary. Still,
Antonio was desperately poor, and he and
his young wife were often uncomfortably
hungry.</p>

<p>Now, if the Madonna would only send him
an Englishman, even if it were only for a
single year, Antonio could easily save enough
money to buy himself a beautiful gondola,
besides living in the lap of luxury. His
brother Spiro had owned an Englishman for
only seven months and a half, and already
he was a capitalist, with his own gondola,
and, figure it to yourself!&mdash;with four hundred
francs in the savings bank! And Spiro had
done nothing to deserve this blessing, for he
was notoriously an unbeliever, and never
went inside a church except when he was
escorting English ladies, when, of course, he
prayed with fervour at the most conspicuous
shrine, which was worth at least ten extra
soldi of <i>buona mano</i>. Whereas, Antonio was
deeply religious, and at least once a year gave
a wax candle to the Blessed Virgin of Santa
Maria Zobenigo. "But patience!" said
Antonio daily to himself. "Some day the
Madonna will grow weary, and will say,
'Give that Antonio an Englishman, so that
I can have a little peace and quiet.' And
then the Englishman will appear, and
Antonio's fortune will be made."</p>

<p>Of course Antonio knew of every foreigner
who came to Venice with the intention of
making a prolonged stay. There is no
detective police in the world that can be
compared with the Venetian gondolier in
learning the ways and purposes of tourists.
To know all about the foreigner is at once
his business and his capital. The Englishman
who comes to Venice and determines to
spend six months or a year in that enchanted
city, may reach this decision on a Saturday
night and mention it to no living soul. Yet
by the following Monday morning all the
gondoliers in Venice know that there is an
Englishman to be striven for, and they have
even settled in their own minds precisely
what apartment he will probably hire. How
they arrive at this knowledge it is not for me
to say. There are mysteries in the Venice of
to-day, as there were in the Venice of the
Ten and of the Three.</p>

<p>Now, it fell out that one day Antonio
learned that an Englishman and his wife, a
young couple, who had every appearance of
sweet temper and scant knowledge of the
world, had arrived at the Albergo Luna, and
had told the porter that they intended to take
a house and live forever in Venice. The
porter was an intimate friend of Antonio, and
had been promised a handsome commission
on any foreigner whom he might place in
Antonio's hands. Within an hour after
receiving the precious information, Antonio
had put on his best shirt, had said ten Aves
at lightning speed, had promised the Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
Virgin two half-pound wax candles in case he
should land this desirable Englishman, and
was back again at the Luna and waiting to
waylay his prey.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 639px;">
<img src="images/i_452.jpg" width="639" height="535" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE PORTER PRESENTED ANTONIO."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The porter presented Antonio, and asserted
that, as a combination
of professional skill
and moral beauty,
Antonio was simply
unique. Mr. Mildmay,
the Englishman in question, was pleased
with Antonio's clean shirt, and Mrs. Mildmay
was captivated by his chestnut curls, and
the frank, innocent expression of the young
fellow's face. He was hired on the spot,
with the new gondola which he professed to
own, for 150 francs per month, including his
board. He was to bring his gondola and his
recommendations to the hotel to be inspected
that afternoon, and was to begin his duties
on the following day, the Mildmays having
already secured an apartment in advance of
their arrival in Venice.</p>

<p>The long-hoped-for fortune had arrived at
last. "He is a man of excellent heart, the
<i>paron</i>," said Antonio to the porter. "He
will be as wax in my hands: already I love
him and the sweet <i>parona</i>. You shall have
your share of him, my Zuane. No one can
say that I am not a just man."</p>

<p>Antonio hurried at once from the hotel
with a note from the porter to a dealer in
gondolas, certifying that the bearer had
secured a most eligible Englishman. He
had to pay a heavy price for the hire by the
month of a nearly new gondola, but the payments
were to form part of the purchase-money,
and Antonio did not grudge the
price. Then he stopped
at his house to
show the new gondola
to his wife, and tell
her the blessed news,
and then, armed with his baptismal certificate,
and an old letter from a notary, informing
him that the funeral expenses of his father
must be paid or serious consequences would
follow, he returned to the hotel.</p>

<p>The Mildmays were satisfied with the
gondola, and with Antonio's recommendations;
for they could not read Italian handwriting,
and when Antonio informed them that
the notary's letter was a certificate that he was
the most honest man in Venice, and that it
had been given him by a German Prince
whom he had served ten years, they were
not in a position to contradict the assertion.
Moreover, they were already half in love
with the handsome and happy face of their
gondolier, and would have taken him without
any recommendation at all, sooner than
have taken an old and ugly gondolier
with the recommendation of the British
Consul and the resident chaplain. The
next day Antonio entered upon his duties,
and began the joyous task of making hay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
while the sun of the Englishman shone on
him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 386px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"HE SHOWED THE NEW GONDOLA TO HIS WIFE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The gondolier in private service in Venice
does many things wholly unconnected with
his boat. He usually waits on his master's
table; he polishes the concrete floors, and he
is sent on every variety of errand. Antonio
was tireless, respectful, and cheerful, and the
Mildmays agreed that he was an ideal
servant. Of course they responded to his
suggestion that he needed a livery, and he
was soon furnished at their expense with a
handsome suit of heavy blue cloth, a
picturesque hat, a silk sash, and an overcoat.
He looked very handsome in his new dress,
and the difference between what he paid the
tailor and what he charged his master
provided his wife and his little boy with their
entire wardrobe for the coming winter.</p>

<p>Venice is a cold city after the winter fogs
begin, and when Antonio advised the Mildmays
to lay in their entire stock of firewood in
September instead of waiting until
the price should be higher, they said
to one another what a comfort it
was to have a servant who really
looked after their interests. So
Antonio was commissioned to buy
the wood, and he bought it. He
made a handsome commission on
the transaction, and, in addition, he
had about one-fifth of the whole
amount of wood delivered at his
own residence. It is true that this
was not quite enough to provide
him fuel for the entire winter, but
the deficiency could easily be
remedied by simply carrying home
three or four sticks under his coat
every night, and Antonio was not a
man who shrank from any honest
labour when the good of his family
was in view.</p>

<p>About ten days after the arrival
of his Englishman, Antonio informed
him that the gondola needed
to go to the <i>squero</i> to have its
bottom cleaned, at a cost of ten
francs. This, however, he insisted
upon paying out of his own pocket,
because the foulness of the bottom
had been incurred before he entered
Mr. Mildmay's service. This scrupulous
display of honesty still further
convinced the Englishman that he
had the pearl of gondoliers, and
when the next day Antonio asked
him to give him as a loan, to be
deducted from his future wages,
fifty francs, wherewith to make certain
essential but wholly unintelligible repairs to
the gondola, Mr. Mildmay was of his wife's
opinion that it would be a shame to require
the poor man ever to repay it.</p>

<p>The first thing that shook the Mildmays'
confidence in Antonio was a little incident in
connection with a chicken. They had had
a pair of roast fowls for dinner and had eaten
only one, intending to have the other served
cold for luncheon the next day. When late
in the evening Mrs. Mildmay accidentally
discovered Antonio in the act of going out of
the house with the cold fowl stuffed under
his coat, she demanded an explanation. "It
is true, <i>parona</i>," said Antonio, "that I took
the fowl. And why? Because all the evening
I had seen you and the <i>paron</i> sitting
together in such love and happiness that my
heart bled for poor Antonio, who has no
happy fireside at which to sit. And so I said
to myself, 'Antonio! surely you deserve a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
little happiness as well as these good and
noble people! Take the cold fowl, and eat
it with love and gratitude in your heart!'"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/i_454.jpg" width="509" height="563" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"TAKE THE COLD FOWL, AND EAT IT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Mildmay could not scold him after
this defence, and she simply contented herself
with telling him that he might keep the
fowl for this time, but that such a method of
equalizing the benefits of fortune must not
occur again. Antonio promised both her
and himself that it should not, and though
he continued to keep his wife's table fully
supplied from that of the Mildmays, the
latter never again found him in possession of
surreptitious chickens.</p>

<p>One day Antonio found a gold piece,
twenty francs in fact, on the floor of his
gondola. He knew it must have been
dropped by the <i>paron</i>, and he promptly
brought it to him. "How wrong I was,"
said Mrs. Mildmay, "to doubt the poor
fellow because of that affair of the chicken.
No one would ever have been the wiser if
he had kept that twenty-franc piece, but he
brought it to us like an honest man." For
once she was right in believing Antonio to
be honest. Nothing could have induced
him to sully his soul and hands by unlawfully
detaining his master's money. He was
determined to make all the money out of
his providential Englishman that he could
make in ways that every gondolier knows to
be perfectly legitimate, but he was no thief,
and Mr. Mildmay could fearlessly
have trusted him with
all the money in his purse.</p>

<p>Antonio was now one of the
happiest men in Venice, but
one morning he came to Mr.
Mildmay with a face of pathetic
sadness, and asked for a day's
holiday. "It is not for pleasure
that I ask it," he said; "my
only pleasure is to serve the
best of masters. But my little
boy is dead, and is to be buried
to-day. I should like to go
with the coffin to San Michele."</p>

<p>Mr. Mildmay was unspeakably
touched by the man's
sorrow and the quiet heroism
with which he bore it. He gave
him the day's holiday and fifty
francs towards the funeral expenses
of his child. When
Antonio appeared in the morning,
quiet, sad, but scrupulously
anxious to do his whole duty,
the Mildmays felt that they
really loved the silent and
stricken man.</p>

<p>Misfortune seemed suddenly
to have run amuck at Antonio.
A week after the death of his
child, he announced in his usual quiet
way that his wife was dead. It was very
sudden, so he said. He did not know
exactly what was the disease, but he thought
it was rheumatism. The Mildmays thought
it strange that rheumatism should have
carried off a woman only twenty-two years
old, but strange things happen in Venice, and
the climate is unquestionably damp. Antonio
only asked for half a holiday to attend the
funeral, and he added that unless the <i>paron</i>
could advance him two hundred francs of his
wages, he should be unable to save his wife
from being buried in the common ditch. Of
course, this could never be permitted, and
Antonio received the two hundred francs,
and Mrs. Mildmay told her husband that if
he should think of deducting it from the
unhappy man's wages, she could never respect
him again.</p>

<p>For a time the darts of death spared the
household of Antonio. The gondola made
its alleged monthly visit to the <i>squero</i> to have
its bottom cleaned at Mr. Mildmay's expense,
and the amount of repairs and paint which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
it needed did seem unexpectedly large. But
Antonio was not foolishly grasping. So long
as he doubled his wages by tradesmen's
commissions, and by little devices connected
with the keeping of the gondola, he felt that
he was combining thrift with prudence. He
made, however, one serious mistake,
of which he afterwards repented when
it was too late. Instead of giving
the Madonna the two wax candles
which he had promised her, he gave
her two stearine candles, trusting that
she would not notice the difference.
It was not in keeping with his honest
and religious character, and there
were times when the recollection of
it made him feel uneasy.</p>

<p>As the winter wore on Antonio's
devotion to his employers never
slackened. Beyond the commissions
which it is but just and right that the
faithful gondolier should exact from
those dogs of tradesmen, even if they
did charge the same commissions in
his master's bills, he was tireless in
protecting the Mildmays from imposition.
He was never too tired to
do anything that he was asked to do,
and although, when his brother Spiro
was temporarily out of employment,
Antonio discovered that there was
nearly always too much wind to render
it safe to take the gondola out with
a single oarsman, and that he would
therefore furnish a second oarsman
in the person of Spiro at his master's
expense, he never intimated that he
was not ready to row hour after hour
while the Mildmays explored the city
and the lagoon. Mr. Mildmay was fascinated
by the narrow Venetian streets, and spent hours
exploring alone every part of the city. He was
probably perfectly safe in so doing, for
highway robbery and crimes of violence are
almost unknown in Venice; but for all that
he was always, though without his knowledge,
accompanied on his walking excursions by
the stealthy and unsuspected Antonio, who
kept out of sight, but in readiness to
come to his assistance should the necessity
arise.</p>

<p>Toward spring Antonio thought it best to
have his wife's mother die, but to his surprise
Mr. Mildmay did not offer to pay the old
lady's funeral expenses. He drew the line at
mothers-in-law, and Antonio received only
his half-holiday to accompany the corpse to
the cemetery. This miscarriage made Antonio
think more than ever of that failure to keep
his promise to the Madonna in the matter of
the wax candles, and he sometimes wondered
if she were capable of carrying her resentment
so far as to take his Englishman from him.</p>

<p>There is gas in Venice, but the judicious
householder does not use it, save when he
desires to enshroud his rooms in a twilight
gloom. If he wishes a light strong enough
to read by, he burns petroleum. It was, of
course, Antonio who supplied the petroleum
to the Mildmay household, and equally of
course, he bought the poorest quality and
charged for the dearest. Now, in spite of
all the care which a timid person may lavish
on a lamp burning cheap petroleum, it is
nearly certain sooner or later to accomplish
its mission of setting somebody or something
on fire, and Antonio's petroleum, which was
rather more explosive than gunpowder, unaccountably
spared the inmates of the <i>casa</i>
Mildmay until late in the month of March,
when it suddenly asserted itself.</p>

<p>It happened in this way. One evening
Mrs. Mildmay took a lamp in her hand, and
started to cross the wide and slippery floor
of her drawing-room. The rug on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
she trod moved under her, and she came
near falling. In the effort to save herself she
dropped the lamp. It broke, and in an
instant she was in a blaze.</p>

<p>Antonio was in the ante-room. The door
was open and he saw the accident. He
sprang to Mrs. Mildmay's assistance. He
did not attempt to avoid the flames, but
rushed directly through the pool of blazing
oil, burning his feet and ankles horribly. He
seized Mrs. Mildmay, and tore away her
dress with his bare hands. He had nothing
to wrap around her, for he was wearing no
coat at the time, but he clasped her close in
his arms, and smothered the flames that had
caught her petticoat by pressing her against
his bosom. She escaped with nothing worse
than a slightly burned finger, but Antonio's
hands, arms, feet and ankles were burned to
the bone. By this time Mr. Mildmay, who
had been in his study, heard his wife calling
for help, and made his appearance.</p>

<p>Antonio asked the <i>parona's</i> permission to
sit down for a moment, and then fainted
away. The cook was called and sent for
the doctor. She met Antonio's brother in
the <i>calle</i>, close to the house, and sent
him upstairs. With his help Antonio
was carried to Mrs. Mildmay's bedroom,
and laid on the bed, and before the
doctor came the wounded man had regained
consciousness, and had thanked the Mildmays
for their care of him.</p>

<p>The doctor, after dressing the wounds,
said that the man might very probably
recover. But Antonio announced that he
was about to die, on hearing which decision
the doctor changed his mind.</p>

<p>"When a Venetian of the lower class
gives up, and says he is going to die," said
the doctor, "no medical science can save
him. Your man will die before morning, if
he has really lost all hope. There! he says
he wants a priest; you might as well order
his coffin at once. I can do nothing to save
him."</p>

<p>"<i>Paron</i>," said Antonio, presently, "would
you, in your great goodness, permit my wife
to come to see me for the last time?"</p>

<p>"You shall have anything you want, my
brave fellow," replied Mr. Mildmay, "but I
thought your wife was dead."</p>

<p>"I was mistaken about it," said Antonio.
"It was her twin sister who died, and they
were so much alike that their own mother
could not tell them apart. No, my poor wife
is still alive. May she bring my little boy
with her?"</p>

<p>"Tell her to bring anybody you may want
to see," replied his master, "but I certainly
thought your little boy was buried last
January."</p>

<p>"The <i>paron</i> is mistaken, if he will pardon
me for saying so. It was my little girl who
died. Was it not so, Spiro?"</p>

<p>Spiro confirmed Antonio's statement, like
a loyal brother who is afraid of no fraternal
lie, and Mr. Mildmay had not the heart to
trouble the sufferer with any more suggested
doubts of his veracity.</p>

<p>Antonio was duly confessed, and received
absolution. "Did you tell the father about
the candles?" whispered Spiro after the priest
had gone.</p>

<p>"I thought," answered Antonio, "that
perhaps the Madonna had not yet noticed
that they were not wax, and that it would
not be wise to tell her of it, just as one is
going where she is."</p>

<p>In the early morning Antonio died. His
family, and Mr. and Mrs. Mildmay, were at
his bedside. He died bravely, with the smile
of an innocent little child on his face. "I
have served the dear <i>paron</i> faithfully," he said,
just as he died. "I know he will take care
of my wife and child. And he will take
Spiro as his gondolier."</p>

<p>Mr. Mildmay religiously carried out
Antonio's dying request. He installed Spiro
in the place of the dead man, and he settled
an annuity on Zanze, the disconsolate widow.
He gave Antonio a grave all to himself in
San Michele, and a beautiful white marble
tombstone, with the epitaph, "Brave, Faithful,
and Honest." He came to know somewhat
later how Antonio had enriched himself at
his expense, but he said to his wife: "After
all, my dear, Antonio was strictly honest
according to his own code. I think I have
known some Englishmen of unblemished
reputation, whose honesty, according to the
English code, could not be compared with
that of the poor boy who gave his life for
yours."</p>

<h3>XXIII.&mdash;ZIG-ZAG SIMIAN.</h3>

<p>Whence has arisen the
notion that monkeys are
happy creatures? Probably
from the inadequate
fact that they pull
one another's tails and
run away. But a being
may be mischievous without
being happy. Many mischievous
boys are never happy:
possibly because the laws of
Nature won't permit of half the
mischief they are anxious to accomplish.
Still, the monkey, at
any rate in a state of freedom,
is looked upon as a typically
happy creature. "And watch
the gay monkey
on high," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
Bret Harte; and Mr. Kipling addresses
the monkey as "a gleesome, fleasome
thou," which latter looks like an attempt
to make an admissible adjective pass in an
unwarranted brother. I have seen monkeys
fleasome, treesome, freesome, keysome
(opposite adjectives these, you will perceive
on reflection), and disagreesome, but
cannot call to mind one that looked in the
least gleesome. Everything that runs up
a fence or swings on a rope is not necessarily
jolly, much as the action would
appear to justify the belief. Many a human
creature has stormed a fence with a lively
desire to attain the dogless side, but no noticeable
amount of jollity; and a man escaping from
fire by a rope wastes no time in unseasonable
hilarity, dangle he never so quaintly. Look at their
faces; look also at the monkey's face. If a monkey
grin, it is with rage; his more ordinary expression
of countenance is one of melancholy reflection&mdash;of
sad anxiety. His most waggish tricks are performed
with an air of hopeless dejection. Now, this may
be due to any one of three causes, or even to a mixture
of them. It may be that, like the boy, he
dolorously reflects that, after all, mischief
has its limits; that you cannot, so to speak,
snatch the wig of the man in the moon, upset
the Milky Way, or pull the tail of the Great
Bear. Or it may be that a constant life of
practical jokes, and of watchfulness to avert
them, is a wearying and a saddening thing
after all. Or it may be that every ape, meditating
on his latest iniquity, tries for ever to
look as though it were the other monkey.</p>

<p>With many people, to speak of the Zoo
monkeys is to speak of Sally. Poor Sally!
Who would not weep for Sally? For Sally
is dead and hath not left her peer. A perversion
of Milton is excusable in the circumstances.
Why is there no memorial of
Sally? "Is the spot marked with no colossal
bust?" as they say on invitations to bachelor
small-hour revels. There should, at least,
be a memorial inscription to Sally.</p>

<p>Sally, when first she came here in 1883,
was a modest and, indeed, rather a shy chimpanzee.
A few years of elementary education,
however, quite changed Sally's character,
for she learnt to count up to five, and to be
rather impudent. Wonderfully uniform are
the results of elementary education.</p>

<p>The chimpanzees, orang-outangs, and
such near relatives of humanity are kept,
when they are alive to keep, in the sloths'
house. Such as are there chiefly occupy
their time in dying. It seems to be the
only really serious pursuit they ever take to.
Sudden death is so popular among them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
that it is quite impossible to know how
many are there at any particular time
without having them all under the eye
at the moment. A favourite "sell"
among them is for a chimpanzee or
orang to become a little educated and
interesting, then wait till some regular
visitor invites all his friends to inspect
the phenomenon, and die just
before they arrive at the door.
This appears to be considered a
most amusing practical joke by
the dead monkey, and is much
persevered in.</p>

</div>

<p>Sally was a black-faced chimpanzee.
The white-faced kind is
more common, and in the days of
its extreme youth much more like
a stage Irishman, except that his
black hair gives him the appearance
of wearing dress trousers very
much frayed at the ankles.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>WHAT WILL HE BECOME?</p></div>
</div>

<p>The orang-outang is less intellectual
as a rule than the chimpanzee;
but he has a deceptive
appearance of brain-pan&mdash;an
illusory height of forehead&mdash;that
earns undeserved respect. Many a man has conducted a successful business with credit on
the strength of a reputation as easily earned. With the
orang as with the chimpanzee, it is in infancy that he presents
the most decently human appearance. But even then he is
a low, blackguard sort of baby&mdash;worse than the precocious
baby of the Bab Ballad could possibly have been. He
should have a pipe for a feeding-bottle and a betting-book to
learn his letters from. These anthropoid apes come with
such suddenness and die with such uncertainty that I cannot
say whether there are any in the Zoo now or not&mdash;I haven't
been there since yesterday. But wanderoos there
are, I feel safe in saying, and Gibbons. The wanderoo
is a pretty monkey, and usually gentle. He has a
grave, learned, and reverend aspect as viewed from
the front, and this is doubtless why, in India, his is
supposed to be a higher caste, respected and feared
by other monkeys. That same wig, however, that
looks so venerable in the forefront
view, is but a slatternly tangle in
profile, like unto the <i>chevelure</i> of a
dowdy kitchenmaid. But a wanderoo,
well taught, and of good-temper,
is as clean and quaint a
pet as you may desire, and as delicate
as the poet's gazelle, with its
incurable habit of dying. The same
may be said of the Gibbon. In
this climate he Declines and Falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
on the smallest excuse, although, perhaps, not
quite so readily as the chimpanzee, who may
almost be said to Decline and Fall professionally,
like Mr. Wegg.</p>

<p>The Diana monkey, too, makes a pleasant pet,
and is not so confirmed a dier as some. The
Diana monkey here is over in the
large monkey-house, in the middle of
the Gardens. Her name is Jessie, and
her beard is most venerable and patriarchal.
But just outside the eastern
door of the big house, John, the Tcheli
monkey, occupies his separate mansion.
John is a notable and a choleric character.
He dislikes
being made
the object
of vulgar
curiosity,
and is apt to
repel an inspection of his premises with a handful
of sawdust. Any unflattering remark on his personal
appearance will provoke a wild dance about
his cage and a threatening spar through the wires.
But once threaten him with a policeman&mdash;do as
much as mention the word, in fact&mdash;and John
becomes a furious Bedlamite, with the activity of a
cracker and the intentions of dynamite. Against
floor, walls, ceiling, and wires he bounces incontinent,
flinging sawdust and language that Professor
Garner would probably translate with hyphens and
asterisks. John is the most easily provoked monkey
I know, and the quaintest in his rage. He is also
the hardiest monkey in the world, being capable
of enjoying a temperature of ten degrees below
zero; but there is a suitable penalty provided in
the by-laws for any person so
lost to decency as to suggest
that this Tcheli monkey is a
very Tcheli monkey indeed.
For John's benefit I would suggest
an extra heap of sawdust
on Bank Holidays. On an
occasion of that sort it is little
less than cruelty to keep him
short of ammunition.</p>

<p>Of the big monkey-house,
who remembers more than a
nightmare of tails, paws, and
chatterings? Here are monkeys
with beards, monkeys with none,
big monkeys, little monkeys,
monkeys with blue faces, monkeys
who would appear to have
escaped into the grounds at
some time and to have sat on
freshly painted seats; all thieving
from visitors and each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
pulling tails, swinging, turning somersaults,
with faces expressive of unutterable
dolor and weariness of the
world. The wizen, careworn face of
the average monkey appeals to me as
does that of the elderly and rheumatic
circus-clown, when his paint has
washed off. The monkey, I am convinced,
is as sick of his regulation
jokes as is the clown of his. But he
has a comic reputation to keep up,
and he does it, though every mechanical
joke is a weariness and
a sorrow to the flesh. "There is
somebody's tail hanging from a
perch," reflects the monkey, looking
lugubriously across the cage.
"I am a joker, and several human
creatures are looking at me, and
preparing to laugh; consequently,
I must pull that tail, though I
would prefer to stay where I am,
especially as it belongs to a big
monkey, who will do something
unpleasant if he catches me." And
with an inward groan he executes the time-honoured
joke and bolts for his life. It is a sad affliction to be
born a wag by virtue of species. There is one monkey
here who for some weeks displayed a most astonishing
reluctance to snatch things through the wires, and a
total disinclination to assist or share in the thefts of his
friends by "passing on" or dividing. For some time I
supposed him to be a moral monkey strayed from a
Sunday-school book, and afflicted with an uncomfortable
virtue. But afterwards
I found that
his conscientiousness
was wholly
due to his having
recently grabbed
a cigar by the hot
end, and imbibed thereby a suspicion of the temperature
of everything. Beware especially, in this house,
of the paws of Marie, the Barbary ape. She has a
long reach, and quickness enough to catch a bullet
shot Poole-fashion&mdash;softly. Only Jungbluth, her
keeper, can venture on familiarities, and him she takes
by the eyebrows, gently stroking and smoothing them.</p>

<p>Behind the large room Jungbluth keeps sick monkeys,
delicate monkeys, tiny monkeys, and curious monkeys,

monkey, segregated because of a slight cold,
and at liberty to train his moustache without interference,
if only it would grow sufficiently long. Watch
the light fur under the chin of a moustache monkey;
it is tinted with a delicate cobalt blue, a colour that
would seem impossible, except in feathers.</p>

<p>But the little marmosets and the Pinche monkey,
all in a cage together, are chiefly interesting here. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
Pinche monkey is badly afflicted with nerves, and,
as he is undisputed chief of the community, the
marmosets have to be careful how they sneeze,
or cough, or blink, or his indignation may be
aroused. So that the whole performance in this
cage is a sort of eccentric knockabout act, by the
celebrated Marmosetti Eccentric Quartette. Marmoset
No. 1 ventures on a gentle twitter, and the
rest join in the song. Promptly the irritated
Pinche bounds from his inmost lair, and the songsters
are scattered. Everybody
doesn't know, by-the-bye, that
the marmoset is consumed
with an eternal ambition to
be a singing bird, and practises
his notes with hopeless perseverance.
Another thing that
many seem to be ignorant of,
even some who keep marmosets
as pets, is that a
marmoset's chief food should
consist of insects. In a state
of freedom he also eats small
birds; but for a pet, cockroaches
and bluebottles will
probably be found, as a
dietary, preferable in
some respects to humming-birds
and canaries.</p>

<p>Among the sick in this
place is a spider monkey.
Mind, I say he <i>is</i> there.
To-morrow, or in five
minutes, he will probably
be somewhere else, for
that is the nature of a
monkey. Sickening, recovering,
dying, snatching,
jumping, tail-pulling,
bonnet-despoiling, everything
a monkey does is
done in a hurry. This particular spider monkey has two or
three names, as Jerry, Tops, and Billy, whereunto he answers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
indifferently; but I prefer
to call him Coincidence,
because of his long arms,
and he answers as well to
that name as to another.
He came in here because
of a severe attack of horizontal
bar in the stomach.
I have never seen a monkey
fall, and, for that
reason, wish I had seen
the attack, as a curiosity.
For, by some accident,
unparalleled in monkey
history, Coincidence
managed to miss his
hold, and fell on his
digestive department
across a perch. He is
a long, thread-papery
sort of monkey, and it
took a little time to
convince him that he wasn't broken
in half. When at last he understood that there was
still only one of him, he set himself to such a doleful
groaning and rubbing and turning up of the eyes, that
Jungbluth put him on the sick list at once. But it
took a very few hours to make him forget
his troubles; and, indeed, I have some
suspicion that the whole thing was a dodge
to secure a comfortable holiday in hospital.
That certainly is the opinion of Coincidence's
friend, the Negro monkey,
as his face will tell you, if you
but ask him the question. It
may interest those who already
know that Coincidence has a
long arm, to know also that he
has but four fingers to each hand
and no thumb; it is a part of
his system. His tail is another
part of his system, and you mustn't touch it. There
is no more affable and friendly monkey alive than
Coincidence, although he is a little timid; but once
touch his tail (it is long, like everything else belonging
to Coincidence), and you lose his friendship for ever.
He instantly complains to Jungbluth, and points you
out unmistakably for expulsion.</p>

<p>It is this house that witnesses most excitement
on Bank Holidays. Who would be a monkey in a
cage set in the midst of a Bank Holiday crowd? I
wouldn't, certainly, if there were a respectable situation
available as a slug in some distant flower pot, or a
lobster at the bottom of the sea. Is a monkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
morally responsible for anything
he may do under the
provocation of a Bank Holiday
crowd? Is he not
rather justified in the possession
of all the bonnets
and ostrich feathers he can
grab by way of solatium?
Bank Holiday is the <i>dies
ir&aelig;</i> of these monkeys, and
then is Professor Garner
avenged. The Professor
shut himself in an aluminium
cage, and the cage
littered about Africa for
some time, an object of
interest to independent
monkeys&mdash;a sort of free
freak show. Here the monkeys,
secure in <i>their</i> cage,
study the exterior freaks,
collecting specimens of their
plumage, whiskers, spectacles,
and back hair. But it
is hard work&mdash;and savage.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>RECOVERING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It takes even a cageful of
monkeys a few days to recover
from a Bank Holiday,
and for those few days trade
is slack indeed. At such
times it is possible to observe
the singular natural
phenomenon of a monkey
in a state of comparative
rest. But he is more doleful
than ever.</p>

I found my patient to be
suffering from a violent attack of delirium
tremens. He was very ill, and for a day or two
his life was in danger. I engaged good nurses
to attend him, and sat up with him myself for
the greater part of two nights. The terrible
malady took a favourable turn, the well-known
painful symptoms abated. I persevered with
the usual remedies to insure sleep, and saw
that he was given plenty of nourishment, and
about a week after his seizure Tollemache
was fairly convalescent. I went to visit him
one evening before he left his room. He
was seated in a great armchair before the
fire, his pipe was near him on the mantelpiece,
and a number of <i>Harper's Magazine</i>
lay open, and face downwards, on a table
by his side. He had not yet parted with his
nurse, but the man left the room when I
appeared.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd give me the pleasure of
your company for half an hour or so," said
Tollemache, in a wistful sort of voice.</p>

<p>I found I could spare the time, and sat
down willingly in a chair at the side
of the hearth. He looked at me with a
faint dawning of pleasure in his sunken
eyes.</p>

<p>"What can I order for you?" he asked.
"Brandy-and-soda and cigars? I'll join you
in a weed, if you like."</p>

<p>I declined either to smoke or drink, and
tried to draw the young man into a light
conversation.</p>

<p>As I did so, finding my efforts, I must
confess, but poorly responded to, I watched
my patient closely. Hitherto he had merely
been my patient. My mission had been to drag
him back by cart-ropes if necessary from the
edge of the valley of death. He was now
completely out of danger, and although
indulgence in the vice to which he was
addicted would undoubtedly cause a repetition
of the attack, there was at present
nothing to render me medically anxious
about him. For the first time, therefore, I
gave Wilfred Tollemache the critical attention
which it was my wont to bestow on
those who were to be my friends.</p>

<p>He was not more than twenty-three or
twenty-four years of age&mdash;a big, rather bony
fellow, loosely built. He had heavy brows,
his eyes were deeply set, his lips were a
little tremulous and wanting in firmness, his
skin was flabby. He had a very sweet and
pleasant smile, however, and notwithstanding
the weakness caused by his terrible infirmity,
I saw at once that there were enough good
points in him to make it worth any man's
while to try to set him on his legs once more.</p>

<p>I drew the conversation round to his
personal history, and found that he was
willing enough to confide in me.</p>

<p>He was an American by birth, but had
spent so much time in Europe, and in
England in particular, that no very strong
traces of his nationality were apparent in his
bearing and manner. He was an only son,
and had unlimited wealth at his command.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three, my last birthday."</p>

<p>"In short," I said, rising as I spoke, standing
before the hearth, and looking down at
him, "no man has brighter prospects than you&mdash;you
have youth, money, and I doubt not,
from the build of your head, an abundant
supply of brains. In short, you can do anything
you like with your life."</p>

<p>He gave a hollow sort of laugh, and poking
the ashes out of his pipe, prepared to fill
it again.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't talk cant, if I were you," he
said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, that sort of speech of yours would
befit a parson."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I rejoined, "I but express
the sentiments of any man who values moral
worth, and looks upon life as a great responsibility
to be accounted for."</p>

<p>He fidgeted uneasily in his chair. He was
in no mood for any further advice, and I
prepared to leave him.</p>

<p>"You will be well enough to go out to-morrow,"
I said, as I bade him good-bye.</p>

<p>He scarcely replied to me. I saw that he
was in the depths of that depression which
generally follows attacks like his. I said a
word or two to the nurse at leaving, and
went away.</p>

<p>It seemed unlikely that I should see much
more of Tollemache; he would be well in a
few days and able to go where he pleased;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
one more visit would probably be the last I
should be obliged to make to him. He
evidently did not respond to my overtures
in the direction of moral suasion, and, much
occupied with other matters, I had almost
passed him from my mind. Two days after
that evening, however, I received a short note
from him; it ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you come and see me as a friend?
I'm like a bear with a sore head, but I
promise not to be uncivil.</p>

<p class="center">"Yours sincerely,
</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">"Wilfred Tollemache."</span><br />
</p>

<p>I sent a reply by my man to say that I
would have much pleasure in visiting him
about nine o'clock that evening. I arrived
at Mercer's Hotel at the hour named. Tollemache
received me in a private sitting-room.
Bottles containing wines and liqueurs were
on the table. There was a box of cigars and
pipes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i_466.jpg" width="520" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I BADE HIM GOOD-BYE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You have not begun that again?" I could
not help saying, glancing significantly at the
spirits as I spoke.</p>

<p>"No," he said, with a grim sort of smile,
"I have no craving at present&mdash;if I had, I
should indulge. These refreshments are at
your service. At present
I drink nothing stronger
or more harmful than
soda-water."</p>

<p>"That is right," I
said, heartily. Then I
seated myself in a chair
and lit a cigar, while
Tollemache filled a
pipe.</p>

<p>"It is very good of
you to give up some of
your valuable time to
a worthless chap like
me," he said.</p>

<p>There was a strange
mingling of gratitude
and despair in the words
which aroused my sympathy.</p>

<p>"It was good of you
to send for me," I rejoined.
"Frankly, I take
an interest in you, but I
thought I had scared
you the other night.
Well, I promise not to
transgress again."</p>

<p>"But I want you to
transgress again," said
Tollemache. "The fact
is, I have sent for you
to-night to give you my confidence. You
know the condition you found me in?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I was in a bad way, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"Very bad."</p>

<p>"Near death&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The next attack will prove fatal most
likely?"</p>

<p>"Most likely."</p>

<p>Tollemache applied a match to his pipe&mdash;he
leant back in his chair and inhaled the
narcotic deeply&mdash;a thin curl of blue smoke
ascended into the air. He suddenly removed
the pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three years of age," he said, aloud,
"the only son of a millionaire&mdash;a dipsomaniac!
Craving comes on about every three
to four months. Have had delirium tremens
twice&mdash;doctor says third attack will kill. A
gloomy prospect mine, eh, Halifax?"</p>

<p>"You must not sentimentalize over it,"
I said; "you have got to face it and trample
on the enemy. No man of twenty-three
with a frame like yours and a brain like
yours need be conquered by a vice."</p>

<p>"You know nothing about it," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
responded, roughly. "When it comes on
me it has the strength of a demon. It shakes
my life to the foundations. My strength
goes. I am like Samson shorn of his locks."</p>

<p>"There is not the least doubt," I
replied, "that the next time the attack comes
on, you will have to make a desperate
fight to conquer it. You must be helped
from outside, for the fearful craving for drink
which men like you possess is a form of
disease, and is closely allied to insanity.
How often do you say the craving seizes
you?"</p>

<p>"From three to four times a year&mdash;in the
intervals I don't care if I never touch a drop
of strong drink."</p>

<p>"You ought never to touch wine, or
strong drink of any kind; your frame does
not need it, and with your peculiar bias it
only acts as fuel to the hidden fire."</p>

<p>"You want me to be a teetotaler?" responded
Tollemache. "I never will. I'll
take no obligatory vow. Fifty vows would
not keep me from rushing over the precipice
when the demon is on me."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to take a vow against
drink," I said, "as you say you would break
it when the attack comes on. But if you
are willing to fight the thing next time,
I wish to say that all the medical skill I
possess is at your service. I have a spare
room in my house. Will you be my guest
shortly before the time comes? You are
warned of its approach, surely, by certain
symptoms?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have bad dreams; I
am restless and nervous; I am
consumed by thirst. These are
but the preliminary symptoms.
The full passion, as a rule,
wakens up suddenly, and I am,
in short, as a man possessed."</p>

<p>Tollemache looked deeply excited
as he spoke. He had forgotten
his pipe, which lay on the
table near. Now he sprang to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Halifax," he said; "I am
the wretched victim of a demon&mdash;I
often wish that I were dead!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_467.jpg" width="600" height="570" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I AM THE WRETCHED VICTIM OF A DEMON."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You must fight the thing
next time," I said. "It will be
an awful struggle, I don't pretend
to deny that; but I believe that
you and I together will be a
match for the enemy."</p>

<p>"It's awfully good of you to
take me up&mdash;'pon my word it is."</p>

<p>"Well, is it a bargain?" I said.</p>

<p>"If you'll have it so."</p>

<p>"You must consider yourself my patient,"
I continued, "and obey me implicitly from
this moment. It is most important that in
the intervals of the attacks your health
should be built up. I should recommend
you to go to Switzerland, to take a sea
voyage, or to do anything else which will
completely brace the system. You should also
cultivate your intellectual qualities, by really
arduous study for a couple of hours daily."</p>

<p>"The thing I like best is music."</p>

<p>"Very well, study the theory of music.
Don't weaken yourself over the sentimental
parts. If you are really musical, and have
taken it up as a pastime, work at the drudgery
part for the next couple of months as if your
bread depended on it. This exercise will put
your brain into a healthy condition, and help
to banish morbid thoughts. Then you must
take plenty of exercise. If you go to Switzerland,
you must do all the walking and the
tobogganing which the weather will permit.
If you go into the country, you must ride for
so many hours daily. In short, it is your
duty to get your body into training condition
in order to fight your deadly enemy with any
chance of success."</p>

<p>I spoke purposely in a light, matter-of-fact
tone, and saw to my satisfaction that Tollemache
was impressed by my words&mdash;he
seemed interested, a shadow of hope flitted
across his face, and his view of his own position
was undoubtedly more healthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>"Above all things, cultivate faith in your
own self," I continued.</p>

<p>"No man had ever a stronger reason for
wishing to conquer the foe," he said, suddenly.
"Let me show you this."</p>

<p>He took a morocco case out of his pocket,
opened it, and put it into my hand. It contained,
as I expected, the photograph of a
girl. She was dark-eyed, young, with a
bright, expectant, noble type of face.</p>

<p>"She is waiting for me in New York," he
said. "I won't tell you her name. I have
not dared to look at the face for weeks and
weeks. She has promised to marry me when
I have abstained for a year. I am not worthy
of her. I shall never win her. Give me the
case." He shut it up without glancing once
at the picture, and replaced it in his breast
pocket.</p>

<p>"Now you know everything," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards I left him.</p>

<p>Tollemache obeyed my directions. The
very next evening a note in his handwriting
was given to me. It contained the simple
information that he was off to Switzerland
by the night mail, and would not be back in
England for a couple of months.</p>

<p>I did not forget him during his absence.
His face, with its curious mingling of weakness
and power, of pathetic soul-longings and
strong animalism, often rose before me.</p>

<p>One evening towards the end of March I
was in my consulting-room looking up some
notes when Tollemache was announced. He
came in, looking fresh and bronzed. There
was brightness in his eyes and a healthy
firmness round his lips. He held himself
erect. He certainly was a very fine-looking
young fellow.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "here I am&mdash;I promised
to come back, and I have kept my word.
Are you ready for me?"</p>

<p>"Quite ready, as a friend," I replied, giving
him a hearty shake of the hand; "but surely
you don't need me as a doctor? Why, my
dear fellow, you are in splendid case."</p>

<p>He sat down in the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"Granted," he replied. "Your prescription
worked wonders. I can sleep well, and
eat well. I am a good climber. My muscles
are in first-class order. I used to be a famous
boxer in New York, and I should not be
afraid to indulge in that pastime now. Yes,
I am in capital health; nevertheless," here he
dropped his voice to a whisper, "the premonitory
symptoms of the next attack have
begun."</p>

<p>I could not help starting.</p>

<p>"They have begun," he continued: "the
thirst, the sense of uneasiness, the bad
dreams."</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, as cheerfully as I could,
"you are just in the condition to make a
brave and successful fight. I have carefully
studied cases like yours in your absence, and
I am equipped to help you at all points.
You must expect a bad fortnight. At the
end of that time you will be on <i>terra firma</i>
and will be practically safe. Now, will you
come and stay with me?&mdash;you know I have
placed a bedroom at your disposal."</p>

<p>"Thanks, but it is not necessary for me to
do that yet. I will go to my old quarters at
Mercer's Hotel, and will give you my word of
honour to come here the first moment that
I feel my self-control quite going."</p>

<p>"I would rather you came here at once."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary, I assure you. These
symptoms may vanish again completely for
a time, and although they will inevitably
return, and the deadly thing must be fought
out to the bitter end, yet a long interval
may elapse before this takes place. I promised
you to come to England the moment
the first unpropitious symptom appeared. I
shall be in your vicinity at Mercer's, and can
get your assistance at any moment; but it is
unfair to take possession of your spare room
at this early date."</p>

<p>I could not urge the matter any farther.
Helpful as I wished to be to this young man,
I knew that he must virtually cure himself.
I could not take his free will from him. I
gave him some directions, therefore, which I
hoped might be useful: begged of him to fill
up all his time with work and amusement,
and promised to go to him the first moment
he sent for me.</p>

<p>He said he would call me in as soon
as ever he found his symptoms growing worse,
and went away with a look of courage and
resolution on his face.</p>

<p>I felt sure that he was thinking of the girl
whose photograph he held near his heart.
Was he ever likely to win her? She was not
a milk-and-water maiden, I felt convinced.
There was steel as well as fire in those eyes.
If she ever consented to become Tollemache's
wife, she would undoubtedly keep him
straight&mdash;but she was no fool. She knew
the uselessness of throwing herself away on a
drunkard.</p>

<p>Tollemache came to see me on the
Monday of a certain week. On the following
Thursday morning, just after I had finished
seeing the last of my patients, my servant
brought me a letter from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>"This should have been handed to you
yesterday," he said. "It had slipped under
a paper in the letter-box. The housemaid
has only just discovered it."</p>

<p>I opened it quickly. It contained these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Halifax</span>,&mdash;The demon gains
ascendency over me, but I still hold him in
check. Can you dine with me to-night at
half-past seven? "Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">"Wilfred Tollemache."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The letter was dated Wednesday morning.
I should have received it twenty-four hours
ago. Smothering a vexed exclamation, I
rushed off to Mercer's Hotel.</p>

<p>I asked for Tollemache, but was told by
one of the waiters that he was out. I reflected
for a moment and then inquired for
the manager.</p>

<p>He came out into the entrance-hall in
answer to my wish to see him, and invited
me to come with him into his private sitting-room.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Dr. Halifax?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, not much," I answered,
"unless you can give
me some particulars with regard
to Mr. Tollemache."</p>

<p>"He is not in, doctor. He
went out last night, between
nine and ten o'clock, and has
not yet returned."</p>

<p>"I am anxious about him,"
I said. "I don't think he is
quite well."</p>

<p>"As you mention the fact,
doctor, I am bound to agree
with you. Mr. Tollemache
came in between six and seven
last night in a very excited condition.
He ran up to his rooms,
where he had ordered dinner
for two, and then came down to
the bureau to know if any note
or message had been left for
him. I gathered from him that
he expected to hear from you,
sir."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/i_469.jpg" width="492" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IN A VERY EXCITED CONDITION."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I am more vexed than I
can express," I replied. "He
wrote yesterday morning asking
me to dine with him, and
through a mistake the letter
never got into my possession until twenty-four
hours after it was written."</p>

<p>"Poor young gentleman," replied the
manager, "then that accounts for the worry
he seemed to be in. He couldn't rest, but
was up and down, watching, as I gather now,
for your arrival, doctor. He left the house
soon after nine o'clock without touching his
dinner, and has not since returned."</p>

<p>"Have you the least idea where he is?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not the faintest; Mr. Tollemache
has left all his things about and has not paid
his bill, so of course he's safe to come back,
and may do so at any moment. Shall I
send you word when he arrives?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pray do," I answered. "Let me
know the moment you get any tidings about
him."</p>

<p>I then went away.</p>

<p>The manager had strict orders to give me
the earliest information with regard to the
poor fellow, and there was now nothing
whatever for me to do but to try to banish
him from my mind.</p>

<p>The next morning I went at an early hour
to Mercer's to make inquiries. The manager
came himself into the entrance-hall to see me.</p>

<p>"There's been no news, sir," he said, shaking
his head: "not a line or a message of any
sort. I hope no harm has happened to the
poor gentleman. It seems a pity you shouldn't
have got the letter, doctor, he seemed in a
cruel way about your not turning up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it was a sad mistake," I answered,
"but we must trust that no disaster has
occurred. If Mr. Tollemache were quite
well, I should not, of course, trouble my
head over the matter."</p>

<p>"He was far from being that," said a
waiter who came up at this moment. "Did
you tell the doctor, sir, about the lady who
called yesterday?" continued the man,
addressing the manager.</p>

<p>"No, I had almost forgotten," he replied.
"A lady in deep mourning&mdash;young, I
should say, but she kept her veil down&mdash;arrived
here last evening about
eight o'clock and asked for Mr.
Tollemache. I said he was out,
and asked if she would wish her
name to be left. She seemed to
think for a moment and then said
'No,' that it didn't matter. She
said she would come again, when
she hoped to see him."</p>

<p>In his intercourse with me,
Tollemache had never spoken of
any lady but one, and her photograph
he kept in his breast pocket.
I wondered if this girl could
possibly have been to see him,
and, acting on the conjecture that
the visitor might be she, I spoke.</p>

<p>"If the lady happens to call
again," I said, "you may mention
to her that I am Mr. Tollemache's
medical man, and that I will see
her with pleasure if she likes to
come to my house in Harley
Street." I then further impressed
upon the manager the necessity of
letting me know the moment any
tidings came of Tollemache, and
went away.</p>

<p>Nothing fresh occurred that
evening, but the next morning,
just when I had seen the last of my patients,
a lady's card was put into my hand. I read
the name on it, "Miss Beatrice Sinclair."
A kind of premonition told me that
Beatrice Sinclair had something to do with
Tollemache. I desired my servant to admit
her at once.</p>

<p>The next moment a tall girl, in very deep
mourning, with a crape veil over her face,
entered the room. She bowed to me, but
did not speak for nearly half a minute. I
motioned her to seat herself. She did so,
putting up her hand at the same moment to
remove her veil. I could not help starting
when I saw her face. I bent suddenly forward
and said, impulsively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know what you have come about&mdash;you
are anxious about Wilfred Tollemache."</p>

<p>She looked at me in unfeigned surprise,
and a flood of colour rushed to her pale
cheeks. She was a handsome girl&mdash;her eyes
were dark, her mouth tender and beautiful.
There was strength about her face&mdash;her chin
was very firm. Yes, I had seen those features
before&mdash;or, rather, a faithful representation
of them. Beatrice Sinclair had a face not
easily forgotten.</p>

<p>"If this girl is Tollemache's good angel, there
is undoubtedly hope for him," I murmured.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/i_470.jpg" width="492" height="574" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I COULD NOT HELP STARTING WHEN I SAW HER FACE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the astonished look on her
face gave way to speech.</p>

<p>"How can you possibly know me?" she
said. "I have never seen you until this
moment."</p>

<p>"I am Tollemache's doctor, and once he
told me about you," I said. "On that
occasion, too, he showed me your photograph."</p>

<p>Miss Sinclair rose in excitement from her
seat. She had all the indescribable grace of
a well-bred American girl.</p>

<p>"The fact of your knowing something
about me makes matters much easier," she
said. "May I tell you my story in a very
few words?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"My name, as you know, is Beatrice
Sinclair. I am an American, and have spent
the greater part of my life in New York.
I am an only child, and my father, who was
a general in the American army, died only
a week ago. It is three years since I engaged
myself provisionally to Wilfred Tollemache.
We had known each other from childhood.
He spoke of his attachment to
me; he also told me"&mdash;here she hesitated
and her voice trembled&mdash;"of," she continued,
raising her eyes, "a fearful vice
which was gaining the mastery over him.
You know to what I allude. Wilfred
was fast becoming a dipsomaniac. I
would not give him up, but neither would
I marry a man addicted to so terrible a
failing. I talked to my father about it, and
we agreed that if Wilfred abstained from
drink for a year, I might marry him. He left
us&mdash;that is three years ago. He has not written
to me since, nor have I heard of him. I grew
restless at last, for I&mdash;I have never ceased to
love him. I have had bad dreams about
him, and it seems to me that his redemption
has been placed in my hands. I induced my
father to bring me to Europe and finally to
London. We arrived in London three weeks
ago, and took up our quarters at the M&eacute;tr&ocirc;pole.
We employed a clever detective to find
out Wilfred Tollemache's whereabouts. A
week ago this man brought us the information
that he had rooms at Mercer's Hotel. Alas!
on that day, also, my father died suddenly.
I am now alone in the world. Two
evenings ago I went to Mercer's Hotel to
inquire for Mr. Tollemache. He was not in,
and I went away. I returned to the hotel
again this morning. Your message was given
to me, and I came on to you at once. The
manager of the hotel told me that you were
Mr. Tollemache's medical man. If he needed
the services of a doctor he must have been
ill. Has he been ill? Can you tell me anything
about him?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you a good deal about him.
Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>She dropped into a chair immediately,
clasping her hands in her lap; her eyes were
fixed on my face.</p>

<p>"You are right in your conjecture," I said.
"Tollemache has been ill."</p>

<p>"Is he alive?"</p>

<p>"As far as I can tell, yes."</p>

<p>Her lips quivered.</p>

<p>"Don't you know where he is now?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I deeply regret that I do not," I answered.</p>

<p>She looked at me again with great eagerness.</p>

<p>"I know that you will tell me the truth,"
she continued, almost in a whisper. "I owe
it to my dead father not to go against his
wishes now. What was the nature of Mr.
Tollemache's illness?"</p>

<p>"Delirium tremens," I replied, firmly.</p>

<p>Miss Sinclair's face grew the colour of
death.</p>

<p>"I might have guessed it," she said. "I
hoped, but my hope was vain. He has not
fought&mdash;he has not struggled&mdash;he has not
conquered."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," I answered; "Tollemache
has both fought and struggled, but up
to the present he has certainly won no
victory. Let me tell you what I know about
him."</p>

<p>I then briefly related the story of our
acquaintance. I concealed nothing, dwelling
fully on the terrible nature of poor Tollemache's
malady. I described to Miss Sinclair
the depression, the despair, the overpowering
moral weakness which accompanies
the indulgence in this fearful vice. In short,
I lifted the curtain, as I felt it was my duty
to do, and showed the poor girl a true picture
of the man to whom she had given her heart.</p>

<p>"Is there no hope for him?" she asked,
when I had finished speaking.</p>

<p>"You are the only hope," I replied. "The
last rock to which he clings is your affection
for him. He was prepared to make a desperate
fight when the next craving for drink
assailed him. You were the motive which
made him willing to undergo the agony of
such a struggle. I look upon the passion for
drink as a distinct disease: in short, as
a species of insanity. I was prepared to
see Tollemache through the next attack.
If he endured the torture without once
giving way to the craving for drink, he would
certainly be on the high road to recovery. I
meant to have him in my own house. In
short, hopeless as his case seemed, I had
every hope of him."</p>

<p>I paused here.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Miss Sinclair. "I see that
you are good and kind. Why do you stop?
Why isn't Wilfred Tollemache here?"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," I replied, "the
best-laid plans are liable to mishap. Three
days ago, Tollemache wrote to me telling me
that he was in the grip of the enemy, and
asking me to come to him at once. Most
unfortunately, that letter was not put into my
hands until twenty-four hours after it should
have been delivered. I was not able to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
the appointment which Tollemache had made
with me, as I knew nothing about it until
long after the appointed hour. The poor
fellow left the hotel that night, and has not
since returned."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 628px;">
<img src="images/i_472.jpg" width="628" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IS THERE NO HOPE?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"And you know nothing about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>I rose as I spoke. Miss Sinclair looked at
me.</p>

<p>"Have you no plan to suggest?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "there is nothing for us to
do but to wait. I will not conceal from you
that I am anxious, but at the same time my
anxiety may be groundless. Tollemache
may return to Mercer's at any moment. As
soon as ever he does, you may be sure that I
will communicate with you."</p>

<p>I had scarcely said these words before my
servant came in with a note.</p>

<p>"From Mercer's Hotel, sir," he said, "and
the messenger is waiting."</p>

<p>"I will send an answer in a moment," I
said.</p>

<p>The man withdrew&mdash;Miss Sinclair came
close to me.</p>

<p>"Open that letter quickly," she said, in an
imperative voice. "It is from the hotel. He
may be there even now."</p>

<p>I tore open the
envelope. There
was a line from
the manager within.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I
send you the enclosed.
I propose
to forward the
dressing-case at
once by a commissionaire."</p>

<p>The enclosed was
a telegram. The
following were its
brief contents:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Send me my
dressing-case immediately
by a private
messenger.&mdash;Wilfred
Tollemache."</p>

<p>An address was
given in full beneath:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Cedars,
110, Harvey Road,
Balham."</p>

<p>I knew that
Miss Sinclair was
looking over
my shoulder as I read. I turned and faced
her.</p>

<p>Her eyes were blazing with a curious mixture
of joy, excitement, and fear.</p>

<p>"Let us go to him," she exclaimed; "let
us go to him at once. Let us take him the
dressing-case."</p>

<p>I folded up the telegram and put it into
my pocket.</p>

<p>Then I crossed the room and rang the
bell. When my servant appeared, I gave
him the following message:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell the messenger from Mercer's," I
said, "that I will be round immediately, and
tell him to ask the manager to do nothing
until I come."</p>

<p>My servant withdrew and Miss Sinclair
moved impatiently towards the door.</p>

<p>"Let us go," she said: "there is not a
moment to lose. Let us take the dressing-case
ourselves."</p>

<p>"I will take it," I replied; "you must not
come."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, keen remonstrance in
her tone.</p>

<p>"Because I can do better without you," I
replied, firmly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe it," she answered.</p>

<p>"I cannot allow you to come with me," I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
said. "You must accept this decision as
final. You have had patience for three
years; exercise it a little longer, and&mdash;God
knows, perhaps you may be rewarded. Anyhow,
you must trust me to do the best I can
for Tollemache. Go back to the M&eacute;tr&ocirc;pole.
I will let you know as soon as I have any
news. You will, I am sure, trust me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fully," she replied, tears suddenly
filling her lovely eyes. "But remember that
I love him&mdash;I love him with a very deep
love."</p>

<p>There was something noble in the way she
made this emphatic statement. I took her
hand and led her from the room. A moment
later she had left me, and I was hurrying on
foot to Mercer's Hotel.</p>

<p>The manager was waiting for me in the
hall. He had the dressing-case in his hand.</p>

<p>"Shall I send this by a commissionaire?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "I should prefer to take
it myself. Tell the porter to call a hansom
for me immediately."</p>

<p>The man looked immensely relieved.</p>

<p>"That is good of you, doctor," he said;
"the fact is, I don't like the sound of that
address."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," I replied.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Dr. Halifax, that the
young lady&mdash;Miss Sinclair, she called herself&mdash;came
here again this morning?"</p>

<p>"I have just seen her," I answered.</p>

<p>The hall porter now came to tell me that
the hansom was at the door. A moment
later I was driving to Balham, the dressing-case
on my knee.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 647px;">
<img src="images/i_473.jpg" width="647" height="436" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A MOMENT LATER I WAS DRIVING TO BALHAM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>From Mercer's Hotel to this suburb is a
distance of several miles, but fortunately the
horse was fresh and we got over the ground
quickly. As I drove along my meditations
were full of strange apprehensions.</p>

<p>Tollemache had now been absent from
Mercer's Hotel for two days and three
nights. What kind of place was Harvey
Road? What kind of house was 110?
Why did Tollemache want his dressing-case?
And why, if he did want it,
could not he fetch it himself? The case
had been a favourite of his&mdash;it had been a
present from his mother, who was now dead.
He had shown it to me one evening, and
had expatiated with pride on its unique
character. It was a sort of <i>multum in parvo</i>,
containing many pockets and drawers not
ordinarily found in a dressing-case. I recalled
to mind the evening when Tollemache
had brought it out of his adjacent bedroom
and opened it for my benefit. All its accoutrements
were heavily mounted in richly
embossed silver. There was a special flap
into which his cheque-book fitted admirably.
Under the flap was a drawer, which he pulled
open and regaled my astonished eyes with a
quantity of loose diamonds and rubies which
lay in the bottom.</p>

<p>"I picked up the diamonds in Cape Town,"
he said, "and the rubies in Ceylon. One or
two of the latter are, I know, of exceptional
value, and when I bought them I hoped
that they might be of use&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he broke off abruptly, coloured, sighed,
and slipped the drawer back into its place.</p>

<p>It was easy to guess where his thoughts
were.</p>

<p>Now that I had seen Miss Sinclair, I felt
that I could better
understand poor
Tollemache. Such
a girl was worth a
hard fight to win.
No wonder Tollemache
hated himself
when he felt his own
want of moral
strength, and knew
that the prize of
such a love as hers
might never be his.</p>

<p>I knew well that
the delay in the
delivery of the note
was terribly against
the poor fellow's
chance of recovery,
and as I drove
quickly to Balham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
my uneasiness grew greater and greater.
Was he already in the clutches of his
foe when he sent that telegram? I felt
sure that he was not in immediate need
of cash, as he had mentioned to me
incidentally in our last interview that he
had drawn a large sum from his bank as
soon as ever he arrived in England.</p>

<p>We arrived at Balham in about an hour,
but my driver had some difficulty in finding
Harvey Road.</p>

<p>At last, after skirting Tooting Bee Common
we met a policeman who was able to acquaint
us with its locality. We entered a long,
straggling, slummy-looking road, and after a
time pulled up at 110. It was a tall house,
with broken and dirty Venetian blinds. The
hall door was almost destitute of paint. A
balcony ran round the windows of the first
floor.</p>

<p>I did not like the look of the house, and
it suddenly occurred to me that I would not
run the risk of bringing the dressing-case
into it.</p>

<p>I had noticed the name of a respectable
chemist over a shop in the High Street, a
good mile away, and desired the driver to go
back there at once.</p>

<p>He did so. I entered the shop, carrying
the case in my hand. I gave the chemist my
card, and asked him if he would oblige me
by taking care of the dressing-case for an
hour. He promised civilly to do what I
asked, and I stepped once more into the
hansom and told the man to drive back as
fast as he could to 110, Harvey Road.</p>

<p>He obeyed my instructions. The moment
the hansom drew up at the door, I sprang
out and spoke to the driver.</p>

<p>"I want you to remain here," I said.
"Don't on any account leave this door until
I come out. I don't like the look of the
house."</p>

<p>The man gave it a glance of quick interrogation.
He did not say anything, but the
expression of his eyes showed me plainly
that he confirmed my opinion.</p>

<p>"I think you understand me," I said.
"Stay here until you see me again, and if I
require you to fetch a policeman, be as quick
about it as you can."</p>

<p>The man nodded, and I ran up the broken
steps of 110.</p>

<p>The door possessed no knocker, but there
was a bell at the side.</p>

<p>I had to pull it twice before it was
answered; then a slatternly and tawdrily
dressed servant put in an appearance. Her
face was dirty. She had pinned a cap in
hot haste on her frowzy head of red hair, and
was struggling to tie an apron as she opened
the door.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Tollemache in?" I asked. "I
wish to see him at once."</p>

<p>The girl's face became watchful and
secretive&mdash;she placed herself between me and
the hall.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman upstairs," she said;
"but you can't see him, he's ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can," I answered. "I am his
doctor&mdash;let me pass, please. Mr. Tollemache
has telegraphed for his dressing-case, and I
have replied to the telegram."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you have brought the parcel, you
can go up," she said, in a voice of great
relief. "I know they're expecting a parcel.
You'll find 'em all on the first floor. Door
just opposite the stairs&mdash;you can't miss it."</p>

<p>I pushed past her and ran up the stairs.
They were narrow and dark. The carpet on
which I trod felt greasy.</p>

<p>I flung open the door the girl had indicated,
and found myself in a good-sized
sitting-room. It faced the street, and the
window had a balcony outside it.</p>

<p>Seated by a centre table drawn rather near
this window were three men, with the most
diabolical faces I have ever looked at. One
of them was busily engaged trying to copy poor
Tollemache's signature, which was scrawled
on a half sheet of paper in front of him&mdash;the
other two were eagerly watching his attempts.
Tollemache himself lay in a dead drunken
sleep on the sofa behind them.</p>

<p>My entrance was so unexpected that none
of the men were prepared for me. I stepped
straight up to the table, quickly grabbed the
two sheets of paper, crushed them up in my
hand, and thrust them into my pocket.</p>

<p>"I have come to fetch Mr. Tollemache
away," I said.</p>

<p>The men were so absolutely astonished at
my action and my words, that they did
not speak at all for a moment. They all
three jumped from their seats at the table
and stood facing me. The noise they made
pushing back their chairs aroused Tollemache,
who, seeing me, tottered to his feet and
came towards me with a shambling, uneasy
gait.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Halifax, old man, how are you?"
he gasped, with a drunken smile. "What
are you doing here? We're all having a
ripping time: lots of champagne; but I've
lost my watch and chain and all my money&mdash;three
hundred pounds&mdash;I've telegraphed
for my cheque-book, though. Glad you've
come, old boy&mdash;'pon my word I am. Want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
to go away with you, although we have had a
ripping time, yes, <i>awfully</i> ripping."</p>

<p>"You shall come," I said. "Sit down
first for a moment."</p>

<p>I pushed him back with some force on to
the sofa and turned to one of the men, who
now came up and asked me my business.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he inquired.
"We don't want you&mdash;you had better get
out of this as fast as you can. You have
no business here, so get out."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have business here," I replied. "I
have come for this man," here I went up to
Tollemache and laid my hand on his
shoulder. "I am his doctor and he is under
my charge. I don't leave here without him,
and, what is more," I added, "I don't leave
here without his property either. You must
give me back his watch and chain and the
three hundred pounds you have robbed him
of. Now you understand what I want?"</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," said one of the
men, significantly. He left the room as he
spoke.</p>

<p>During his absence, the other men stood
perfectly quiet, eyeing me with furtive and
stealthy glances.</p>

<p>Poor Tollemache sat upright on the sofa,
blinking with his heavy eyes. Sometimes he
tried to rise, but always sank back again on
his seat. During the whole time he kept
muttering to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, good fellows these: jolly time,
champagne, all the rest, but <i>I'm robbed</i>;
this is a thieves' den. Don't leave me alone,
Halifax. Want to go. You undershtand.
Watch and chain gone, and <i>all my money</i>;
three hundred in notes and gold. Yes, three
hundred. Won't let me go till I give 'em
my cheque-book; telegraphed for cheque-book
in dressing-case. You undershtand, yes.
Don't leave me, old boy."</p>

<p>"It will be all right," I said. "Stay
quiet."</p>

<p>The position was one of extreme danger
for both of us. There was nothing whatever
for it but to carry matters with a cool
hand and not to show a vestige of fear.
I glanced round me and observed the position
of the room. The sofa on which Tollemache
was sitting was close to the window. This
window had French doors, which opened on
to the balcony. I edged close to it.</p>

<p>I did not do this a moment too soon. The
man who had left the room now returned
with a ruffian of gigantic build, who came up
to me at once with a menacing attitude.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 639px;">
<img src="images/i_475.jpg" width="639" height="447" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WHO ARE YOU?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Who are you?" he said, shaking his
brawny fist in my face. "We don't want <i>you</i>
here&mdash;get out of this room at once, or it
will be the worse for you. We won't 'ave
you a-interfering with our friends. This gent
'ave come 'ere of <i>his own free will</i>. We like
him, and 'e's 'eartily welcome to stay as long
as 'e wants to. You'd best go, ef you value
your life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>While he was speaking I suddenly flung
my hand behind me, and turning the handle
of the French window threw it open.</p>

<p>I stepped on to the balcony and called to
the cabman: "Stay where you are," I said,
"I may want you in a moment." Then I
entered the room again.</p>

<p>"I don't wish to waste words on you," I
said, addressing the burly man. "I have
come for Mr. Tollemache, and I don't mean
to leave the house without him. He comes
away with me the moment you return his
watch and chain, and the three hundred
pounds you have stolen from him. If you
don't fetch that watch and chain, and that
money, I shall send the cabman who is waiting
for me outside, and who knows me, for
the police. You are best acquainted with
what sort of house this is, and with what sort
of game you are up to. It is for you to say
how near the wind you are sailing. If you
wish the police to find out, they can be here
in a minute or two. If not, give me the
money and the watch and chain. I give you
two minutes to make your choice."</p>

<p>Here I took out my watch and looked at
it steadily.</p>

<p>I stepped again on to the balcony.</p>

<p>"Cabby," I shouted, "if I am not with you
in <i>three minutes from now</i>, go and bring a
couple of policemen here as quickly as
ever you can."</p>

<p>The cabman did not speak, but he took
out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p>I re-entered the room.</p>

<p>"Now you know my mind," I said. "I
give you two minutes to decide how to act.
If Mr. Tollemache and I are not standing on
the pavement in three minutes from now, the
police will come and search this house. It
is for you to decide whether you wish them
to do so or not."</p>

<p>I was glad to see that my words had an
effect upon the biggest of the ruffians. He
looked at his companions, who glanced back
at him apprehensively. One of them edged
near me and tried to peer over my shoulder
to see if the cabman were really there.</p>

<p>Tollemache went on mumbling and muttering
on the sofa. I stood with my back to the
window, my watch in my hand, marking the
time.</p>

<p>"Time's up," I said, suddenly replacing
the watch. "Now, what do you mean to
do?"</p>

<p>"We'd best oblige the gent, don't yer think
so, Bill?" said one of the men to his chief.</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," said the chief. He
came close to me again.</p>

<p>"Now, look you 'ere," he said, "you'd best
go out quiet, and no mischief will come.
The gent 'ere 'e give us the watch and chain
and the money, being old pals of his as he
picked up in New York City."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," shouted Tollemache.</p>

<p>"Stay quiet," I said to him.</p>

<p>Then I turned to the ruffian, whose hot
breath I felt on my cheek.</p>

<p>"We do not leave here," I said, "without
the watch and chain and the money. My
mind is quite made up. When I go, this
gentleman goes, and we neither of us go
without his property."</p>

<p>These words of mine were almost drowned
by the heavy noise of an approaching dray.
It lumbered past the window. As it did so,
I stepped on to the balcony to acquaint the
cabman with the fact that the three minutes
were up.</p>

<p>I looked down into the street, and could
not help starting&mdash;the cab had vanished.</p>

<p>I turned round quickly.</p>

<p>The big man had also stepped upon the
balcony&mdash;he gave me an evil glance. Suddenly
seizing me by the collar, he dragged me
back into the room.</p>

<p>"You ere a humbug, you ere," he said,
"wid yer bloomin' cabs&mdash;there ain't no cab
there&mdash;no, nor never wor. Ef you don't
go in one way you go in another. It ain't
our fault ef things ain't quite agreeable.
Come along, Sam, lend a 'and."</p>

<p>The next moment the ruffian had laid me
flat on my back on the floor, and was kneeling
on my chest.</p>

<p>Tollemache tottered from the sofa, and
made a vain struggle to get the brute away.</p>

<p>"You get out of this," the fellow thundered
at him. "I'll make an end of you, too, ef
you don't look out."</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and took out a
huge clasp-knife.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, feeling sure that my
last hour had come. At this moment,
however, the rapidly approaching sound of
cab wheels was distinctly audible. A cab
drove frantically up and stopped at the door.</p>

<p>The four ruffians who were clustered
round me all heard it, and the big man took
his knee off my chest.</p>

<p>Quick as thought I found my feet again,
and before anyone could prevent me, leaped
out on to the balcony. Two policemen were
standing on the steps of the house&mdash;one of
them had the bell-pull in his hand and was
just about to sound a thundering peal.</p>

<p>"Stop," I shouted to him; "don't ring
for a moment&mdash;stay where you are."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
Then I turned and faced the group in the
room.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 625px;">
<img src="images/i_477.jpg" width="625" height="568" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I FELT SURE THAT MY LAST HOUR HAD COME."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It is not too late," I said; "I give you
one minute's grace. Return this gentleman's
watch and chain and the three hundred
pounds you have stolen from him, and I say
nothing to the two policemen who are now
waiting on the steps. If I have not the
money back within a minute, the police
enter your house&mdash;now you can choose."</p>

<p>I saw by the expression on the face of the
bully who had knocked me down that he
was only too eager to accede to my request.</p>

<p>"Come on, Bill," he said to one of his
pals, "I suppose there ain't nothing for it but
to do what the gen'leman says. Yes, yes,
you be quiet, sir, and you'll have all the
swag&mdash;lor', we only pulled you down by way
of a joke, and as to the money and the other
waluables, we was <i>keeping</i> 'em for the gent.
Who'd want to rob a poor innercent like
that? You promise not to peach on us, sir?"</p>

<p>"Be quick," I shouted. "I give you a
minute, no more&mdash;give me the money and
the watch and chain. You had better hurry
up."</p>

<p>They did hurry up with a vengeance. The
big man was as great a coward as he was a
ruffian. As he thrust his hands deep into
his trousers pockets, I saw that he was absolutely
shaking with fright. Tollemache's
magnificent watch and chain were laid on the
table, and all four men turned their pockets
out and deposited gold and notes by the side
of the other property. I stepped up to
the table and reckoned the money. Two
hundred and eighty pounds and the watch
and chain were returned to me. The remaining
twenty pounds were, I plainly saw,
hopelessly gone. It was not worth fighting
for them. I put the gold and notes and the
watch and chain into my pocket, and going
up to Tollemache took his arm.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, "we can go now."</p>

<p>The terror which must have seized him
when he saw me struggling on the floor
had partly sobered him, but now he had
returned to the most imbecile stage of his
horrible vice. He struggled to his feet and
clutched hold of me.</p>

<p>"Want my pipe," he muttered. "I say,
old boy, won't go without my pipe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<p>I had hard work to keep my patience. He
was a big man, and I could not control
him against his will. We were by no means
yet out of the wood. The four ruffians were
eyeing us as if they would only too gladly kill
us both by slow torture. Never before had
I encountered eight such diabolical eyes as
those which they fixed upon me. And there
stood Tollemache, with an idiotic smile on
his face, and imagining that he was doing a
wonderful and clever thing when he refused
to stir without his pipe.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," I said, sternly, to him.
"Come, now, I'll get you your pipe to-morrow."</p>

<p>To my relief he seemed satisfied with this
assurance, and suffered me to drag him across
the room.</p>

<p>When we reached the door the big ruffian
came up and intercepted us.</p>

<p>"We have your word not to peach?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied&mdash;"let me pass."</p>

<p>He did so, and I helped Tollemache as
best I could downstairs.</p>

<p>The four men watched our descent over
the banisters.</p>

<p>As soon as I had got my patient out on the
steps, one of the policemen came up to me.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, sir?" he demanded.
"Can we help you?"</p>

<p>"This gentleman is hopelessly drunk," I
replied&mdash;"I thought it possible I might need
your assistance in getting him from the
house. You will oblige me much by helping
me now to put him in the cab."</p>

<p>"No other trouble in there, sir?" asked
the man, meaningly.</p>

<p>"None," I answered. "Will you kindly
take the gentleman's other arm?"</p>

<p>The policeman did so&mdash;his eyes were full
of significance. He guessed, of course, that
I was hiding something, but it was not for
him to make any further remarks.</p>

<p>I took Tollemache straight back to my own
house, and for the next week I had once
again to lend him what aid I could in fighting
the terrible demons who attack the
victims of delirium tremens. I engaged two
skilful men to nurse him, and, between us,
we managed to drag the poor fellow away
from the shores of death.</p>

<p>All this time I was in daily communication
with Beatrice Sinclair. I got to know her
well during these dark days. She was a girl
to win the respect and admiration of any man,
and she undoubtedly won mine. There was
something grandly simple and unconventional
about her.</p>

<p>"I am alone in the world," she said to me
many times; "my mission in life is to save
Wilfred Tollemache."</p>

<p>"You will not save him by marrying him
in his present state," I answered her.</p>

<p>She raised her brows and looked at me
in some slight surprise.</p>

<p>"I have no intention of marrying him
at present," she said. "Nothing would
induce me to unite my lot with that of a
drunkard&mdash;besides, I promised my father.
I will marry Wilfred when he has abstained
from drink for a year&mdash;not before."</p>

<p>"If he abstains for a year he will be
cured," I replied.</p>

<p>There came an evening when Tollemache
was sufficiently convalescent to come downstairs.
I had not yet said anything to him
about Miss Sinclair, but as I knew she was
impatient to see him, I wondered if it might
be safe for me to break the news of her
arrival on the scene to him that evening.
He sat in my consulting-room huddled up by
the fire. The evening was a warm one in
April, but he looked chilly and depressed.</p>

<p>I drew a chair near him and sat down.</p>

<p>He looked at me with languid eyes out of
a cadaverous face.</p>

<p>"I can't make out why you are so good to
me," he said. "I am not worth the thought
of a man like you."</p>

<p>I did not reply for a moment. Then I
said, tersely:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It would be a great victory to save you,
and I believe it can be done."</p>

<p>"I have a sort of memory," said Tollemache,
"of your having already saved my
life at the risk of your own."</p>

<p>"That is true," I answered.</p>

<p>"How can I pay you back?" he asked.
"Will money&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No," I interrupted, harshly, springing to
my feet as I spoke&mdash;"money won't. I want
you to become a man again: that is my
reward."</p>

<p>He seemed to shrink into himself; there
was not a scrap of fibre about him at
present.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," I said, "how you got
into that den?"</p>

<p>He roused himself a little at this, and some
animation came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"That was partly your fault," he said.
"You did not keep your word; you never
came to me when I wrote to you. I told
you that I was losing self-control&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I interrupted him to explain why I had
not received his letter.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I spent a day of fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>ful
torture. I knew I was on the brink of
a precipice, and that unless you pulled me
back, against my will, over I must go. I
returned to Mercer's in the evening and
looked eagerly for your note. None had
arrived. I waited for you until nine o'clock,
and then in a sort of frenzy went out. I
had a very stiff brandy-and-soda, which
pulled me together for a bit, and seeing a
music-hall in Oxford Street, I went in.
There I was supplied with fresh drink, and
while I was indulging, a man of the name of
Hawker, who had once seen me in a drunken
condition in New York, came up and
claimed acquaintance. I knew, the moment
I looked at the fellow, that the demon had
got the upper hand. Hawker talked, and
supplied me with fresh drink. He introduced
me to a companion as low as himself. I
have a dim remembrance of driving away
with these men and of spending the night
over cards and unlimited drink. In the
morning I wanted to leave, but the fellows
threatened me, and in my drunken state I
was no match for them. Hawker sat down
near me and asked a lot of questions, to
which I replied as readily as if I were a
baby. I don't know how that day or the
next passed. I gave Hawker the address
of the hotel where I was staying, and told
him about my dressing-case and its valuable
contents. Hawker filled in a telegram
to the manager of the hotel, which he made
me sign. When it was sent off, he gave me
a sheet of paper and desired me to write my
signature on it. I did so&mdash;the men then sat
round a table and began to copy it. The
horrors of delirium tremens were already upon
me, and my mind became filled with all
manner of terrible imaginings. I closed my
eyes and dozed off. When next
I opened them, you were standing
in the room."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"CAME UP AND CLAIMED ACQUAINTANCE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You were practically out of
your mind," I replied; "but the
thing is over, and well over. By
the way, have you ever thought,
during the last terrible fortnight,
of the photograph which you
were good enough to show me?"</p>

<p>Tollemache started and clenched
his nerveless hand.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of it," he said.
"The one thing left to me to be
thankful for, is that she has not
linked her life with mine."</p>

<p>"You have undoubtedly much
cause to be thankful," I replied.
"The wife of a drunkard is the
most miserable woman on God's
earth. Please pardon me, however,
if I pain you a little by
speaking about the girl whose
photograph you showed me. Do
you mind telling me her name?"</p>

<p>"Beatrice Sinclair."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"Twenty&mdash;there is really no
use in this catechism, Halifax."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to pain you," I
replied, briefly; "but the fact is, I
was struck with Miss Sinclair's face&mdash;there
is a great deal of strength
in it. If you conquered your fault,
she would be the woman of all others to
keep you straight. She is, I am certain,
attached to you. To win a girl like Beatrice
Sinclair ought to be a motive strong enough
to make any man conquer a vice like
yours."</p>

<p>Tollemache was now intensely agitated.
He sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he said, "she has forgotten
all about me. It is three years since she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
has heard my name. She has in all probability
married another man long ere this."</p>

<p>"I am sure she has not," I answered.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his breast pocket,
and drew out the case which contained the
photograph.</p>

<p>"Many a time I have wanted to put this
into the fire," he said. "I dare not part
with it, and yet I dare not look at it."</p>

<p>"Keep it," I said: "there is hope for you
while you have it."</p>

<p>"There isn't a ghost of hope for me," he
said. He threw himself back again into his
chair, and covered his face.</p>

<p>My servant came into the room and
brought me a message.</p>

<p>"Tollemache," I said, "a lady has called
who wishes to see me. Will you forgive me
if I leave you for a minute or two?"</p>

<p>He growled out some reply which was
scarcely intelligible, and I left the room.</p>

<p>I went into my library, where Beatrice
Sinclair was waiting for me.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, coming up to me eagerly,
"is he ready for me?"</p>

<p>"He thinks you have forgotten him," I
said, "and that in all probability you are
married to another."</p>

<p>"What a cruel thought!"</p>

<p>"But he keeps your photograph in his
breast pocket."</p>

<p>"Does he, indeed?" Her eyes blazed
with sudden joy.</p>

<p>"He is tempted often to throw it into the
fire," I continued, "for he feels himself
unworthy of you; but he neither dares to
throw it away nor to look at it."</p>

<p>"He shall look at me instead. Take me
to him at once."</p>

<p>"You will see the wreck of the Tollemache
you used to know."</p>

<p>"He shall not be a wreck long. I have
vowed to save him. My life is at his
service."</p>

<p>"Remember your promise to your father."</p>

<p>"I remember it. I will not break it.
Now take me to him."</p>

<p>She came up to me and held out her hand.
I took it and went with her to the door of
the next room, opened it, and motioned to
her to enter.</p>

<p>When she did so, I closed it softly and
came away.</p>

<p>I had a firm conviction that with such
unexpected aid, Tollemache would have
moral strength to overcome the vice which
was ruining him.</p>

<p>Subsequent events proved that I was right.</p>

<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p class="center">(VIEWED BY HENRY W. LUCY.)
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE
QUEEN'S
SPEECH.</div>

<p>There is something gravely
comical in the manner the London
morning newspapers deal
with the Queen's Speech on the
morning preceding its communication to Parliament.
They know all about it, and, as the
event proves, are able to forecast it paragraph
by paragraph. Yet, withal, they shrink from
any assumption of positive knowledge, or
even of attempt to foretell what will take
place. "Her Majesty," they write, "must
of necessity allude to the progress of events
in Central Africa and on the East of that
dark but interesting continent." You learn
half a day in advance of the opening of
Parliament exactly what Ministers have
resolved to say on this particular topic.
Other events of current interest at home
and abroad are introduced in the same
casual manner, and are dealt with in similar
detail. Mr. Wemmick had carefully studied
this style, and had successfully assimilated
it with his ordinary conversation and methods
of transacting business.</p>

<p>The general impression is that editors
of the principal London papers receive a
copy of the Queen's Speech on the night
before the Session opens, with the understanding
that they are to treat it
gingerly, and, above all, to safeguard
Ministers from suspicion
of collusion in the premature
publication. To adopt the consecrated
style, I may observe
that this will probably be found to
be a misapprehension. Doubtless
what happens is that the
editor of the morning paper
meets at his club a Cabinet
Minister of his acquaintance,
who, following immemorial usage,
feels at liberty to give his friend
a conversational summary of the
points of the Speech. Or it
may happen that an appointment
is made with the Whip
authorized to make such communication.
Certainly it will,
upon investigation, appear that
there is no foundation for the
fiction of a written copy of
the Speech being supplied for
editorial use. Years ago the
editor, either of the <i>Times</i> or
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, profiting by personal
acquaintance, was able on the morning
of the meeting of Parliament to
forecast the Queen's Speech. He invented,
as desirable in the circumstances, the
roundabout style of communication alluded
to. The following year other papers,
working the oracle on the same lines, adopted
the same primly mysterious style. There is
no reason why this should now be done;
but done it is, as the eve of the Session, still
young, testified. New journalism has been a
potent agency in varying Press usages. It
has not yet ventured to attack this decrepit
old farce.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">BEFORE
DINNER
AND AFTER.</div>

<p>The only copy of the Queen's
Speech which passes outside the
Ministerial ken before the
Session opens is that forwarded,
with the compliments of the Leader of the
House, to the Leader of the Opposition.
This is an act of grace and courtesy, happily
and accurately illustrating the spirit in
which controversy is carried on in English
politics. Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone
maintained no social relations outside the
House of Commons. But that was an exception
to the ordinary course of things. At this
day the stranger in the gallery
hearing Mr. Chamberlain pouring
contumely and scorn on Sir
William Harcourt, and observing
the Chancellor of the Exchequer
almost savagely retorting,
may be forgiven if he
supposes the cleavage in political
relations has severed personal
friendships. That is certainly
not the fact in respect of these
two former colleagues, or of
other more or less prominent
combatants in the Parliamentary
arena. It frequently happens,
in the course of the Session,
that two members who, between
the hours of five and seven-thirty,
have been engaged in
fiercest controversy in the House
of Commons, will be found at
eight o'clock sitting at the same
dinner-table, discussing the situation
from quite another point
of view. This is a condition
of affairs which does not exist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
certainly not to equal extent, in any other
political battlefield, whether at home or
abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FOURTH
PARTY AND
THE QUEEN'S
SPEECH.</div>

<p>When the Fourth Party was in
the plenitude of its power, it
pleased its members to assume
all the customs of those larger
political factions of which it
was the microcosm. Since Ministers and the
Leaders of the regular Opposition were in
the habit of meeting together on the eve of
a new Session, dining, and thereafter reviewing
the situation and settling their policy, the
Fourth Party had their pre-Sessional dinner.
Lord Randolph Churchill tells me of a charming
incident connected with this custom.
Meeting on the eve of the Session of 1881,
they solemnly agreed that they, as a Party,
were at a disadvantage inasmuch as they had
not before them a copy of the Queen's Speech.
Lord Randolph accordingly wrote a formal
letter, addressed to Lord Richard Grosvenor,
then Ministerial Whip, asking him to
be so good as to favour him and his
colleagues with a copy of Her Majesty's
gracious Speech, in accordance with custom
when the Leaders of Her Majesty's
Opposition were in conference on the eve of
a Session. I do not know whether Lord
Richard, in the fashion of his reply, rose to
the sublime height of this joke. But the
copy of the Speech was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>The Fourth Party at the beginning of their
career went a step further than the regular
Leaders of the Opposition whom they, only half
in jest, affected to supersede. Her Majesty's
Ministers, in accordance with custom, went
down to Greenwich for a whitebait dinner at
the end of the Session, the Leaders of the
Opposition being content with a festive gathering
on the eve of the opening of Parliament.
The Fourth Party, equal to both occasions, not
only convivially foregathered at the opening
of the Session, but had their whitebait dinner
at the end. In 1880, the year of their birth,
they, never afraid of creating a precedent, invited
an outsider to join the feast. This was
Mr. Labouchere, Mr. Bradlaugh's standard-bearer,
whom they had been fighting hand to
hand all through the turbulent Session.</p>

<p>But it is a poor heart that never rejoices,
and in their young days the Fourth Party
were merry grigs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUNTY
GUY.</div>

<p>Some time ago inquiry was made
in the columns of a country paper
as to the origin of the cognomen
"County Guy," as attached to
Lord Hartington. I happen to know that
the phrase, much in vogue seventeen or eighteen
years ago, appeared in the series of
papers entitled "Under the Clock," published
weekly in the <i>World</i>. It was suggested by
Sir Walter Scott's well-known lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bird, breeze, and flower proclaim the hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where is County Guy?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lord Hartington was at the time Leader of
the Opposition, vice Mr. Gladstone, convinced
that "at my time of life"&mdash;he was sixty-five
when he wrote&mdash;his public work was finished,
and he had earned the right to spend his
declining years in the comparative leisure of
his library. Even the eminence of the position,
and the hitherto unbroken habit of the Leader
of a party being in his place when questions
began, did not overcome Lord Hartington's
constitutional inability to come up to time.
It was characteristic of him that he scorned
the opportunity provided for quietly dropping
into his place, without fixing attention upon
his delayed arrival. He might have entered
from behind the Speaker's Chair and taken
his seat without any but those in the immediate
neighbourhood noting the moment of
his appearance on the scene. He always
walked in from the doorway under the clock,
in full view of the House, usually with one
hand in his pocket, his hat swinging in the
other hand, lounging towards his seat as if he
were rather five minutes too soon than half an
hour too late. When, in the last Parliament,
he returned to the Front Opposition Bench
as Leader of the Liberal Unionists, he
observed precisely the same custom. He
was invariably late, even at critical epochs,
and always walked in by the front door.</p>

<p>On one occasion he arrived very early in
the morning, but that was an accident due to
misunderstanding. It was during the passage
of the Coercion Act of the Salisbury Parliament.
The Irish members had kept things
going all night. At five o'clock in the morning,
Lord Hartington, in common with other
absentees of his party, received a telegram to
the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Been on duty all night. Only us two here.
Come down to relieve us.</i></p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) "<span class="smcap">Chamberlain,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Russell</span>."</p>

<p>This was enough to make even Lord
Hartington hurry up. The picture of Mr.
Chamberlain standing by the Government all
night, warring with the common enemy, whilst
the Leader was comfortably in his bed, was a
reflection not pleasant to dwell upon. Hurrying
on his clothes he made his way down
to the House, one of a steady stream of
Liberal Unionists like himself, abashed to
think they had left Mr. Chamberlain in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
lurch. Entering the House, they came upon
Mr. T. W. Russell and Mr. Richard Chamberlain,
keeping guard on the heights where
the Liberal Unionists encamp.
It was all right, of
course. But it was not Mr.
Richard Chamberlain who
was in their mind when they
hurried down in obedience
to the imperative command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRIVILEGES
OF
M.P.'S.</div>

<p>Apart from the
question of wages
members of the
British House
of Commons do not condescend
to acceptance of
the various smaller privileges
which ameliorate the condition
of legislators in other
countries. In some of the
Continental Legislatures, and
in most of the Colonies,
M. P.'s travel free on the
railways. For the British
member, more especially for
the Irish representative, the
cost of locomotion when
going about the country's
business is a serious item.
Not to speak of the occasional discomforts of
the voyage, it costs an Irish member over &pound;5 to
journey to and from Westminster. For many
Dublin is merely the starting point for a more
or less prolonged trip over the highly-priced
and not conveniently-arranged home railways.</p>

<p>At Washington, members of the House
of Representatives, in addition to a fixed
salary and liberal allowance for railway
fares, have various little pickings, in the
way, for example, of stationery, which is
supplied <i>ad libitum</i> for their private use.
Another privilege, indispensable to the due
performance of their labours, is a bath.
Attached to the Legislative Chamber is one
of the most luxurious bathing establishments
in the world. Anything, from the ordinary
cold tub to the most elaborate Turkish bath,
is at the disposal of members. The prospect
of being able to retire from a heated
debate and enjoy the long luxury of a
Turkish bath is sufficient to make a British
M. P.'s mouth water. Of course, there is the
difficulty about the imminence of divisions.
The sound of the division bell, suddenly
clanging through the various chambers of a
Turkish bath, would cause dire consternation.
But daily use would suggest a means of
minimizing possible inconvenience. There
might, for example, come into existence such
a thing as a bath pair, corresponding with
the present dinner pair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DRESSING-ROOM
TRAGEDY.</div>

<p>It will appear
scarcely credible
that the House
of Commons,
though widely known as the
best club in the world, lacks
the accommodation, common
to an ordinary club, of dressing-rooms
where members
may change their clothes for
dinner. The convenience of
such an arrangement is particularly
obvious in the case
of a body of men, the
majority of whom dine out
during the Session, and are
frequently, by the imminence
of a division, kept waiting
about to within a quarter of
an hour of the time at which
they are due for dinner.
Ministers have their private
room. But for this purpose
it is of less use to them
than to the private member.
They are not supposed to
dine out whilst the House is in Session,
and if they, greatly daring, dine, they
avail themselves of the privilege of presenting
themselves in morning dress. Occasionally
one lends his room to a private
friend, hard pressed to keep a dinner engagement,
possible only if he can save the
time involved in going home to dress.</p>

<p>A few Sessions ago, a well-known Q.C. had
an exciting adventure consequent upon changing
his dress at the House. He had arranged
with a friend in the Ministry, who had a
chamber near the top of the staircase leading
into Palace Yard, to use it as a dressing-room.
He anxiously watched the course of the
debate as it proceeded over seven o'clock,
hoping it would conclude in time for him to
run into his friend's room, and slip into his
dinner-dress in time to keep his appointment.
At half-past seven things began to look
bad. A member, usually good for at
least half an hour, had risen to continue
the debate. On second thoughts, here was a
chance. Suppose he were to retire now,
change his clothes, and be ready to drive off
as soon as the division lobby was cleared?</p>

<p>He acted on the idea with characteristic
promptitude, and had reached an exceedingly
critical stage in the change of raiment,
when the division bell rang. The mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>ber
in possession of the House when he
left it had been unexpectedly merciful, had
brought his remarks within the limits of
ten minutes, and the division was called.
Only three minutes elapse between the
clearing of the House for a division and
the putting of the question. Supposing the
Q.C. to be fully dressed, there was only time
comfortably to reach the House from the
Minister's room. He was certainly not
dressed, and it was a nice question whether it
would be a shorter process to go back to the
chrysalis state of morning dress, or proceed
to complete the butterfly development upon
which he had embarked when almost paralyzed
by the sound of the division bell. One
thing was clear, he must take part in the
division. An issue depended on it which
would not incline the Whips to accept
frivolous excuse for abstention.</p>

<p>Again a happy thought occurred to him.
Suppose he were to put on an overcoat and so
hide his collarless condition? But his overcoat
was in the cloak-room, a flight lower down.
The spectacle of a learned and somewhat
adipose Q.C. rushing downstairs in shirt and
trousers might lead to misapprehension.
There was, however, nothing else to be done,
and the flight was successfully accomplished.
The hon. member safely reached the cloak-room,
was helped on with his coat, and, with
collar turned up closely buttoned at the
throat, he passed through the Division Lobby,
an object of much sympathy to his friends, who
thought his cold must be bad indeed to justify
this extreme precaution on a summer night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIVILEGE.</div>

<p>It is a well-known fact, much
appreciated in quarters personally
concerned, that no action for
libel may be based upon words spoken in the
House of Commons. This understanding
has been confirmed by an action to which
Mr. Arthur Balfour was an involuntary party.
In the course of debate, in which he took
part as Chief Secretary, he had spoken disrespectfully
of a midwife in the south of
Ireland. The lady's friends rallied round
her, and guaranteed funds to cover the
expenses of a civil action for damages brought
against the Chief Secretary. Had the case
come before a Cork jury, as was inevitable if
it went to trial, it would doubtless have proved
a profitable transaction for the plaintiff. Mr.
Balfour appealed to a higher Court, on the
ground that the words spoken in Parliamentary
debate are privileged. The Court sustained
this view, and the trial was set aside.</p>

<p>I have high judicial authority for the
statement that in spite of this rule the
position of a member of Parliament in the
matter of libel is not impregnable. He is
quite safe, not only as far as words spoken
in the House are concerned, but is not
responsible for their publication in the newspapers,
or their subsequent appearance in
"Hansard." "Hansard," however, is accustomed
to send to each member a report of his
speech, leaving to him the option of revision.
If the proof be not returned within a few
days it is assumed that no correction is
desired, and the speech goes down to posterity
in the form it was handed in by the
reporter. When a member has revised his
speech the fact is intimated by a star.</p>

<p>It is herein the distinction in the matter
of legal liability is established. A member
having voluntarily revised his speech is
assumed, by the fresh and independent
action taken outside the House of Commons,
to have assumed a liability he would
otherwise have escaped. An action would
lie against him, not for the speech delivered
in Parliament, but for the publication of
the libel under his revision, and upon his
authority, in a widely circulated periodical.
<i>Verb. sap.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">A PRECIOUS
VOLUME.</div>

<p>A glance over any volume of
"Hansard" shows that it is only
the new or inconsiderable member,
whose speeches are not likely
to become the texts of subsequent debate,
who is at pains to revise reports of his Parliamentary
utterances. Old Parliamentary
hands like Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Balfour, and
Mr. Chamberlain are, in the first place, too
busy, and, in the second, too wise, to commit
themselves to the task.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain once suffered from
yielding to the temptation to secure an
accurate report of his deliverances on
important political questions. In 1885,
on the precipice below which unexpectedly
lay the fissure in the Liberal Party, Messrs.
Routledge brought out a series of volumes
containing reports of the speeches of some
six or eight statesmen on questions of the
day. It was an "authorized" edition, the
various contributors revising their speeches.
At this epoch Mr. Chamberlain was the risen
hope of the Radical Party. His vigorous
argument and incisive invective were directed
against the Conservative Party, its history,
ancient and modern. It is from this little
volume that Mr. Gladstone, in his speech at
Edinburgh just before the Winter Session,
drew the citation of Mr. Chamberlain's indictment
of the House of Lords. It was not
the first time it had been remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
But Mr. Gladstone's joyous discovery sent
it trumpet-tongued throughout the English-speaking
world. It is this compilation that
rescued from the obscurity of daily newspaper
reports the happily conceived, perfectly
phrased, and now classical similitude
drawn between Mr. Gladstone and
a mountain.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think," Mr. Chamberlain
said in a passage the perfect literary form
of which tempts to quotation, "that great
men are like mountains, and that we do not
appreciate their magnitude while we are still
close to them. You have to go to a distance
to see which peak it is that towers
above its fellows; and it may be that we
shall have to put between us and Mr. Gladstone
a space of time before we shall know
how much greater he has been than any
of his competitors for fame and power. I
am certain that justice will be done to him
in the future, and I am not less certain that
there will be a signal condemnation of the
men who, moved by motives of party spite,
in their eagerness for office, have not hesitated
to treat with insult and indignity the
greatest statesman of our time&mdash;who have
not allowed even his age, which entitles
him to their respect, or his high personal
character, or his long services to his Queen
and his country, to shield him from the
vulgar affronts and the lying accusations of
which he has nightly been made the subject
in the House of Commons. He, with his
great magnanimity, can afford to forget and
forgive these things. Those whom he has
served so long it behoves to remember them,
to resent them, and to punish them."</p>

<p>The speech in which this gem lies entombed
was delivered at Birmingham, on the
4th June, 1885. In the intervening nine
years Mr. Chamberlain has had opportunities
of regarding the mountain from other
points of view, and has discovered quite
new aspects.</p>

<p>This volume of Mr. Chamberlain's speeches
has long been out of print. The shilling edition
and the half-crown edition command considerably
enhanced prices on the rare occasions
when they come upon the market. There is
one precious copy in the Library in the
House of Commons, the condition of which
testifies to the frequency of reference. The
existence of such a record may be occasionally
embarrassing to the politician, but if
Mr. Chamberlain were vain, it must be
gratifying to the man. It is only a strong
personality that could evoke such testimony
of eager interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORDS
IN THE
COMMONS.</div>

<p>It is pretty to note the deathless
attraction the House of
Commons has for members who
have left it to take their seats in
another place. They may be peers privileged
to sit in the stately Chamber at the other
side of the Octagon Hall. But their hearts,
untravelled, fondly turn to the plainer
Chamber in which is set the Speaker's Chair.
Even the Duke of Devonshire has not been
able wholly to resist the spell. Whilst he
was still member for Rossendale, it was only a
heroic, predominant sense of duty that brought
him down to the Commons. Since he became
a peer scarcely an evening passes in the Session
that he does not look in, chatting with friends
in the Lobby, sometimes sitting out an hour
of debate, watched from the gallery over the
clock. Lord Rowton never had a seat in
the Commons other than that under the
gallery allotted to the Private Secretary of the
Leader of the House. But in earlier days he
had much business in the Lobby of the House
of Commons, and when in town and in attendance
on the House of Lords, he rarely misses
the opportunity of revisiting his old haunts.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"A CHAT WITH SIR HENRY JAMES."</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is many years since Lord Morris was
"the boy for Galway," representing the
county through several Sessions. Through
that avenue he joked his way, first to be
Solicitor-General, then Attorney-General,
next Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
finally Lord of Appeal, with a life peerage.
During the debates in the Commons last
Session on the Home Rule Bill he was in
constant attendance. Even when the subject-matter
of debate is not one that touches
the heart of a patriot, the ex-member for
Galway is regularly seen in the Lobby of
the House of Commons, his presence being
indicated by a ripple of laughter in the
group surrounding him.</p>

<p>For some Sessions after the House of
Commons suffered the irreparable loss of the
counsel of Sir Richard Cross, the Lobby was
occasionally suffused by the air of wisdom
and respectability inseparable from the
presence of Lord Cross. Last Session he
intermitted this habit, the Lobby becoming
in his absence almost a resort for the frivolous.
Lord Monk-Bretton is another old Commoner
who has not entirely overcome the habit of
strolling into the Lobby of the House
in whose Chair of Committees he once sat.
Lord Playfair, another ex-Chairman of Committees,
is often seen there. The Earl of
Aberdeen, before Canada claimed him, was
almost nightly in the Lobby and corridors of
the House of Commons, albeit he was not
drawn thither by personal recollections of
former memberships. Dukes, except his
Grace of Devonshire, rarely descend on the
level of the Lobby, and no Bishop has been
seen there since the Bishop of London,
looking in surplice and bands after
debate in the House of Lords, was accosted
by Mr. McClure and genially invited to take
a glass of sherry and
bitters.</p>

<p>Lord Battersea
has
rather cut
the place
in which he long
lingered as a Whip,
and Lord Dartmouth
is not often seen in the
place where through
many Sessions Lord
Lewisham used to
walk about, Whips'
book in hand, endeavouring
to keep a
House through the
dinner hour. Lord
Kensington is a regular
frequenter of
the Lobby, and instinctively
takes his
stand near the door
leading to the staircase
where through many Sessions he kept
guard, barring the passage of unpaired
members. Lord Kensington is not a man of
supercilious manner, but there was something
of unmistakable scorn in his eyes when they
first alighted on the screen which his successors
in the Ministerial Whips' seat last
Session introduced. Certainly a searching
wind creeps up the staircase from Palace
Yard when it is wintry weather. But Lord
Kensington sat there from 1880 to 1885
without so much as a rug on his knees. A
more degenerate race are inconsolable
without some contrivance for warding off
the draught. In ordinary circumstances
this object might easily be attained. A
screen of fair proportions flanking the
bench by the Whips' side would be fully
effective. But this is the main entrance
to the Lobby. A full-sized screen would be
impossible. Accordingly, a something has
been made considerably too tall for the base
upon which it stands. The consequence is
embarrassing, sometimes appalling. Either
the Thing falls outward when the glass door
is opened, scaring the new arrival, or it flops
inward, threatening to crush Mr. Causton,
and cut off, in its flower, a useful life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD
DENMAN AND MR.
ATKINSON.</div>

<p>Lord Cranbrook has long got
over the habit once dominant of
revisiting the scenes in which his
political fortunes were established.
Lord Denman never had a seat
in the Commons, but his sad, grey figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
crowned with the purple smoking cap,
was familiar in the Lobby in the last
Parliament. The attraction for him was
removed when Mr. Farmer-Atkinson retired
from the political stage. In the former
member for Boston, Lord Denman found a
kindred spirit. They made a pact together
whereby the peer was to take charge of the
Commoner's Bills when they reached the
Upper House, Mr. Atkinson performing a
kindred service for his noble friend when his
Woman's Suffrage Bill had run the gauntlet
of the Lords. It came to pass that opportunity
was not forthcoming on either side for
fulfilment of this pledge. The Peers would
not pass Lord Denman's Bill, nor did
the Commons encourage Mr. Atkinson's
legislative efforts. Still, they took counsel
together, prepared for emergencies. Sometimes
they would be found in consultation
by the big brass gates that shut off the House
of Lords from common people. Oftener
Lord Denman, having fuller leisure, sought
Mr. Atkinson in the Lobby of the Commons.
Beyond particular measures for the good of
the country in which they were interested,
they cherished a dream of a combination
between really sensible men of both Houses,
who, rising above party purposes and prejudices,
should devote themselves heart and
soul to placing the empire on a sounder
foundation.</p>

<p>The development of this plan was interrupted
by officious friends placing some
restraint on the movements of Mr. Farmer-Atkinson,
and his (only temporary it is to be
hoped) withdrawal from public life.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LORD HERSCHELL.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">TWO
UMBRELLAS.</div>

<p>Lord Herschell, once
a regular frequenter
of the
Lobby, does not often find
time to look in now that
he is Lord Chancellor,
and in addition to the
ordinary weighty calls of
his office, has in hand the
revision of the Commission
of the Peace. Another
peer, once a constant
visitor, who has abandoned
the place, is the Earl of
Ravensworth. He was
long known in the House
of Commons as Lord Eslington,
a representative of
the highest type of county
member. When he succeeded
to the peerage he
spent more time in the Lobby of the Commons
than on the red benches of the House of
Lords. Whatever the season of the year
or the prospect of the weather, he brought
his umbrella with him, a heavily constructed
article, capable of sustaining the weight of a
properly tall man when he leaned upon it,
whilst he conversed with a circle of friends.</p>

<p>The only member whose faithful attachment
to his umbrella equalled Lord
Ravensworth's was the late Mr. Tom
Collins. Judging from the shade of the
gingham, the determination of the bulge
in the middle where it was tied round with
a piece of tape, and the worn condition of
the ferrule, the umbrella dated back to the
epoch of the Great Exhibition. So dear was
it to the heart of its owner that he would not
risk accident or loss by leaving it to take its
chance with the miscellaneous multitude in
the cloak-room. Like Lord Ravensworth,
he carried it with him in
all weathers, and before
entering the House to take
part in the solemn institution
of prayers, he reverently
deposited it behind
the chair of the principal
doorkeeper. Mr. Collins
was not a man of abnormally
suspicious nature. All
his colleagues in the House
of Commons were honourable
men. Still, human
nature is weak. To see
an umbrella like that hanging
loosely on a peg, or to
find it ready to hand mixed
up with a lot of ordinary
articles, might prove too
strong a temptation for a
weak brother. Mr. Collins
spared many a possible
pang by placing his umbrella
out of range of casual sight
in personal charge of the
doorkeeper.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">London</span> numbers many
societies for artists; but there
is not another so quaint in its
style and so characteristic in
all its methods as the Langham
Sketching Club, or, as it is
called in brief parlance, and, in fact, more
correctly, "The Langham," for the Sketching
Club is in reality only a part of the whole.
It is a very modest and retiring body, and
does not make much ado, or call public
attention to itself by the usual and popular
methods of gaining notoriety.</p>

<p>These have always been its leading
characteristics. It thought so little of itself,
indeed, in the first instance that it allowed
itself to be ushered into existence in a lowly
shed at the bottom of a mews, or in a
stonemason's yard, as some say. This
humble abode was situated in Clipstone
Street, Fitzroy Square, and the society's
nativity took place what time the Sailor King
ruled the land, some eight years before Her
present Gracious Majesty ascended the
throne.</p>

<p>It was started by eight men, who wished by
co-operation and emulation to improve themselves
and each other in the art which they
had adopted as their profession; and it is
significant of the oddity which has ever
characterized the society and its proceedings
that, no sooner had the resolution been
carried confining its membership to the eight
founders, than it admitted a ninth. These
nine original members were: W. Kidd, F.
Gary, J. C. Zeitter, A. M. Huffam, John
Knight, William Purser, William Derby, J.
Mimpriss, and William Brough, the latter
being the honorary secretary.</p>

<p>According to the rules they framed for
their governance, the society was to be "for
the study of artistic human figures." It was
to meet three times a week, in the evening,
and work for a couple of hours. Each
member on joining was called upon to subscribe
ten shillings; after which, his contribution
consisted in paying his share of the
expenses. These were totted up at the end of
the week, and then and there settled. Fines
were imposed for non-attendance, unless the
absentee were able to produce good and sufficient
reason for his non-appearance; and for
a long time to come the chief business of
the committee appears to have been to impose
these fines, then remit them, or discuss
the means of enforcing their payment upon
men who were generally light-hearted, except
when weighed down by the lightness of their
pockets. Peace be to their souls! If there
were not many Michael Angelos among them,
there was an infinite amount of good-fellowship.</p>

<p>The actual date of this simple and democratic
constitution was March 9, 1830; but
it had no sooner been framed than&mdash;as in
the case of another and more famous constitution&mdash;it
was found necessary to go to
work and tinker it into shape and usability.
Hence, between then and now, it has undergone
many changes, albeit nothing has been
done to detract from its broad fundamental
characteristics. The club (for such, in fact,
it is) may be said to combine the greatest
amount of good-fellowship with the least
possible restraint by rule and regulation.</p>

<p>A year after the society's foundation a
somewhat radical change took place. It had
quickly been found impossible to confine its
membership to the original nine founders,
and the number was gradually increased to
fifteen. Now it was decided to divide the
society into members and subscribers; the
former paying a pound a quarter and constituting
the governing body; while the latter
paid twenty-seven shillings and had no part
whatever in the management&mdash;in this also
following the example of our national Constitution
as it then was.</p>

<p>At first members and subscribers were
alike ten in number; but in course of time
the members were increased to fifteen, and a
larger proportion of subscribers admitted.
This rule still obtains. A still further development
took place a month or two later,
when it was decided to elect a president, the
first gentleman to be accorded the honour
being Mr. Knight.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, until this time it had
never occurred to the members that their
society was without a name. The fact
having been accidentally discovered, it was
resolved to adopt as style and title, "The
Artists' Society for the Study of Historical,
Poetic, and Rustic Figures."</p>

<p>From time to time the number of evenings
devoted to study was gradually increased,
until every week-day evening was occupied.
Further developments had in the meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
taken place. In 1841, on the suggestion of
William J. M&uuml;ller, the study of the antique
was included in what we may call the curriculum.
This involved the renting of another
room (the society was still in its mews) at
a cost of &pound;25 a year. About the same time
the study of the
nude was introduced,
and became
henceforth
a leading feature
of the society.
In 1838 an attempt
had been
made to form a
society for ladies,
in conjunction
with the Artists'
Society, "for the
study of costume
and the draped
figure," but although
started
with some <i>&eacute;clat</i>,
it appears before
long to have
ended without
regret a brief
and forlorn existence.</p>

<p>We soon begin
to come across
historical names.
In 1835 Haydon
presents the society
with a drawing
of "The
Gate Beautiful,"
by Raphael,
made by his pupil,
C. Landseer.
Mr. D. V. Riviere
is elected,
also a Mr. F. Cruikshank, though he appears
never to have attended. Two years later
Mr. E. Corbould becomes a subscriber, and
in the year following, the well-known watercolourist,
Frank W. Topham, and Mr. W.
Riviere. In 1839 Dodgson and Lee were
elected subscribers; and the same year the
veteran Louis Haghe, still living, was made
president.</p>

<p>During these early years courses of lectures
on various subjects connected with art were
given by competent gentlemen. Mr. W. R.
Toase, F.L.S., discoursed on "Anatomy,"
illustrated by living models; Mr. Benjamin
R. Green lectured on "Perspective"; Mr.
C. H. Smith, on the "Importance of Trifles
in Historical Design"; Mr. George Foggo,
on "Pictorial Composition"; and last, though
not least, a Mr. R. Cull (one fancies there
should have been an "s" to this name), on
"Phrenology as Applicable to Art." At that
time phrenology was in high favour, was
patronized by
the great and
the learned, and
generally regarded
as going
to do wonders.
Many artists in
those days, Blake
and Linnell
among the number,
devoted
some attention
to it; but now,
with the exception
of one leading
Academician,
it would be difficult
to find any
artist who had
given so much
as a passing
glance at the
science: if they
had, we should
at least have been
spared the sight
of such monstrosities
of heads
as we now see.</p>

<p>In 1841, under
the presidency
of John
Absolon, another
veteran member
who is still
amongst us, it
was decided to
elect a certain number of honorary members,
and Mr. James R. Planch&eacute;, the dramatist
and authority on costume and heraldry, was
the first gentleman chosen. In honour of this
election a conversazione was held, to which a
number of distinguished guests were invited.
This was the first entertainment of the kind
given by the society. Since then it has
become noted for its gatherings of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>At one time the rule was to hold one every
quarter. This was when the treasury was in
good order. When funds were low it was
necessary to be satisfied with two, or even
one, a year. They were&mdash;and are still&mdash;the
very simplest of affairs, and Bohemian to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
last degree. For this reason it is that they
are so much enjoyed by those who have the
luck to get an invitation. The invariable
fare is bread and cheese and salad&mdash;<i>au naturel</i>&mdash;with
ale and stout <i>ad lib.</i>, or, as a facetious
member once put it, <i>ad lip</i>. Anything of the
nature of ceremony is altogether dispensed
with; and as there is always a crush, the
feast generally assumes the form of a
scramble. City magnates have been known
to take part in these <i>sans fa&ccedil;on</i> regales,
and to confess afterwards that they found
them more amusing and enjoyable than a
Guildhall banquet; while fashionable R. A.'s
and A. R. A.'s have been seen to retire into a
corner with a hunk of bread and cheese in
one hand and a pot of porter in the other, and
set to like costers&mdash;showing that we are all built
much on the same mould, under the clothes.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A CONVERSAZIONE SUPPER.</p>

<p><i>Drawn by W. H. Pike</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On these occasions the
members exhibit their
works&mdash;sketches that have
been done in the classroom,
or pictures destined
for one or other of the
exhibitions&mdash;and receive
the useful, and generally
very generous, criticisms
of their friends. Then, to
round off the evening, there
are singing, music, and recitations,
or it may be a bit
of character acting. Once
we had the pleasure of
seeing a well-known A. R. A.
and another equally clever
artist dress up from the
club wardrobe (which is a
rich and varied one) as
"Black Sall" and "Dusty
Jim," and give an improvised
dance, to the infinite
delight alike of members
and guests.</p>

<p>But&mdash;to go back a little&mdash;in
1842 the most characteristic
feature of all in
connection with the society
had its beginning, namely,
the Sketching Club. This
is, in reality, quite distinct
from the society, although
members may belong to it;
but its membership is recruited
chiefly from outside,
and is practically unlimited.
The club meets
every Friday evening, a
subject&mdash;or, perhaps, two&mdash;is
given, and each artist realizes it as best
he can. The sketch has to be completed
in two hours, and when the time is
up, there is a general examination of
work, with free criticism, suggestion, and
so forth. They may be done in any manner&mdash;in
oil, water-colours, black and white, or
modelled in clay. It is a capital school;
every man is put on his mettle, and, of course,
does his best. Not a few pictures, now
celebrated, had their beginnings on these
evenings.</p>

<p>Work being done, supper is discussed; the
fare consisting of a cold joint, bread and
cheese, with, of course, ale and stout to wash
them down. It is at this time that new
members are elected. Before a candidate
can be chosen he has to submit a sketch.
This is carried round by the honorary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
secretary and shown to each member in turn,
his vote for or against the candidate being
thus taken.</p>

<p>These suppers are always interesting, and
sometimes very amusing, as they can hardly
help being when so many men of varied
talent, and some of absolute genius, are constantly
meeting together and exchanging
views. Sometimes, while the others are
talking, or "chaffing," one member will be
quietly jotting down some characteristic
faces in his sketch-book, or taking a sly
note on his cuff. At other times the fun
becomes a little uproarious, and the wildest
pranks are indulged in.</p>

</div>

<p>On one occasion the late Charles Keene
and Mr. Stacy Marks, both of whom were
members for many years, had a jumping
match. A rod was laid lightly from the rail
round which the members work to a box at a
height of about three and a half feet from
the ground. Marks cleared the rod with
ease at a standing jump. Keene, though he
tried several times, could not quite accomplish
the feat. When he seemed to be on
the point of giving up the contest an artist
named Wingfield, "a fellow of infinite jest,"
and a great character to boot, said, very
quietly, "Take a pinch of snuff, Mr. Keene;
that will enable you to do it." The suggestion
was given with such placid <i>sangfroid</i>
that it convulsed the room. Keene, however,
did not take the hint.</p>

<p>Keene was elected a full member of the
society in 1853, though he had already been
a subscribing member for several years. He
was one of the quietest of men, and seldom
had much to say for himself; howbeit, he
did occasionally come out with a dry, caustic
remark, that told like one of the sly, humorous
touches of his pencil; as, for instance, when
he bade an old woman who was castigating
her ill-mannered donkey, hired for the evening
as a model, that she might spare the rod
there, as none of them minded his behaviour,
because they were not any more thin-skinned
than her "moke."</p>

<p>Tenniel, Keene's coadjutor on <i>Punch</i>, was
president of the society so far back as 1849.</p>

<p>Among other distinguished or notable men
who have been, or still are, members, may be
mentioned Mr. Poole, R.A., some of whose
sketches are as grand as many of his finished
pictures are weak. He was a fellow-member
with H. B. Pyne and James M&uuml;ller. The
latter was president in 1844, and died during
his year of office, killed, as it was thought at
the time, by the scant justice done to him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
the Academy; his works, now so highly
esteemed, being invariably "skied." While his
pictures now fetch thousands, he died in debt
to the society. Alfred Fripp, the watercolour
painter, and Fred Goodall became
members about the same time. Between
1846 and 1848, Stanfield, junr., W. Goodall,
W. Dyce, H. J. Boddington, and A. J.
Lewis joined the society, and J. P. Knight,
R.A., was elected an honorary member.
A little while previously the same honour
had been conferred upon Mr. G. Field, the
colour manufacturer, and Mr. J. H. Rogers,
lecturer on anatomy.</p>

<p>In 1860 the society removed from the
quarters it occupied in Clipstone Street to
its present abode in the Langham Chambers,
Portland Place. Of the men who were then
members not many are left, but we may
name Charles Cattermole, nephew of the
famous George Cattermole, and for many
years hon. secretary of the society, and J. A.
Fitzgerald, son of Byron's "hoarse" Fitzgerald,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and almost as noted as his father
for his histrionic gifts. Several who were
then members have since left, notably
Mr. Lawlor, the sculptor, the late Vicat Cole,
R.A., and F. Weekes. A. J. Stark also was
a member at that time. G. Kilburne joined
the society shortly after it removed to
Langham Chambers; B. W. Leader, R.A.,
Henry Telbin, the scene painter, and C.
Armitage joined a year later; while between
then and 1865, Robert Landells, a man of
great ability, who went through the Franco-German
War as artist for the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>, E. T. Coleman, J. T. Watson,
F. Lawson, W. M. Wyllie, G. G. Kilburne,
E. Law, the engraver, James Gow, and Fred
Barnard became members or subscribers.
Later, Sir James Linton joined the society, the
late Mr. C. B. Birch, A.R.A., and William
Linnell, son of the famous Linnell, and himself
a distinguished painter.</p>

<p>There is generally, just before "sending-in
day," a special conversazione, at which members
exhibit their pictures before forwarding
them to the Academy to be accepted or
rejected. In many cases, of course, this is
the only "show" they get; but not a few
famous pictures have there been submitted
to public criticism for the first time. At one
such conversazione Mr. Stacy Marks exhibited
his famous "Gargoyle" before it
went to the Royal Academy. Mr. Calderon,
R.A., thus exhibited his "Coming of Age,"
and Fred Walker his celebrated "Philip in
Church," the picture which was the beginning
of his fame. Calderon was a member of
the Sketching Club; as was also Mr. Poynter,
R.A. Fred Walker was a regular member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
of the society. At one time Mr. W. Gilbert,
since become famous in another line of art,
was a member, though not for long. He had
not yet found his true <i>forte</i>, and so was trying
his hand with the brush. What he did was
chiefly in the comic vein. He was an amusing
companion, however, and noted as a
<i>raconteur</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A TWO-HOURS' SKETCH BY CHAS. CATTERMOLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An amusing story is told in this connection,
albeit not of Mr. Gilbert: At one of
the Friday night suppers there was present
an artist who had
been abroad for
some time in
connection with
one of the illustrated
papers.
He had been
half round the
world, and was,
naturally, expected
to have
much to say
about his travels.
But, no; not a
word. "What
did you see in
China, Mr. Ixe?
What in Japan?
Did you like the
Assyrian maidens,
or the <i>Vrows</i>
of Batavia?"
Thus was he
questioned on
every side. But,
like the needy
knife-grinder, he
had no story to
tell. Meanwhile,
at the other end
of the table was
an artist who had
that afternoon
been as far as Bedford Park, and was bursting
with adventures. "Fitz could make a better
book of travels out of a walk up Hammersmith
Broadway than Ixe from a tour round the
world," remarked one of the wits of the club.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the time to hear from the artists'
own lips their varied experiences&mdash;often
highly amusing&mdash;in the pursuit of their profession.
One, who has a supreme hatred of
dealers, tells how he once had one delivered
completely into his hands, <i>and he
did not drown
him</i>. He and
three others had
taken a walk up
the Wharfe to
enjoy its beauties,
one of them
being a dealer.
The dealer and
another eventually
found themselves
on the
wrong side of the
stream, far from
a bridge, and it
was necessary, in
order to avoid a
long d&eacute;tour, to
wade across.
The dealer was
no longer young,
was unused to
the water, except
as a beverage,
being a teetotaler,
and feared
all sorts of evils
as the result
of wetting his
feet. He managed
to get
across in safety,
however.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p>"He reached our side of the river all
right," continued the narrator; "but as the
bank was steep, he had to appeal to me to
give him a hand up; and I weakly did so,
instead of putting a mop on him. I could
easily have done so, the water being quite
deep enough to put him out of his misery.
But I didn't do it. Of course, I felt considerable
chagrin when I had let him escape.
Then, to make matters worse, he asked me
for some of my whisky: he knew I carried a
little in a bottle&mdash;'for my stomach's sake.'
Naturally, having been so weak as to let him
get out of the water, I could not refuse
the whisky. And what do you think
he did? He washed his feet with it to prevent
him catching cold! I implore of you,
should it fall to the lot of any of you to have
your enemy delivered into your hands in that
way, do not do as
I did, but <i>put a
mop on him</i>."</p>

<p>It is only needful
to begin storytelling
in this way
to bring out an endless
variety. The
mention of the
Wharfe reminded
one man of a deep
pool below a waterfall
on a northern
stream, where he
had a most gruesome
experience.
He had planted his
easel, and was beginning
to work
upon the scene&mdash;the
waterfall, the
black pool, dark
surrounding trees,
and a blurred and
reddening evening
sky&mdash;when suddenly
he perceived
a dark object bobbing
up and down
just in front of
the fall. Up and
down it danced
with the motion of
the water, gyrating
slowly at the same
time. At first he
thought it must be
a dead dog; then
it dawned upon
him&mdash;and the
thought produced an uncanny feeling&mdash;that
it might be a man's head. Suddenly a
stronger wave, a more violent gyration, and
there was no longer any doubt. A man's
face, with its dead, glassy eyes and streaming
hair, was presented to his gaze&mdash;and he
instantly sprang to his feet and ran, leaving
easel, canvas, palette, and brushes to take
care of themselves.</p>

<p>Another man tells how, when he was busy
upon a choice bit of landscape, a couple of
yokels approached, and, after watching for a
short time, moved off, remarking that it was
a pity such a broad-shouldered fellow could
not find something better to do than waste
his time like that.</p>

</div>

<p>Naturally, there are some stock anecdotes
told of fellow-members, which never cease to
create a laugh. One hears of the sculptor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
who, having been too
deep in his potations,
made his way home
late at night with a
large codfish under
one arm and a lobster
under the other,
and who found them
lying in bed beside
him when he awoke
in the morning.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>J. A. FITZGERALD.</p>

<p><i>Drawn by Robert Sauber.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Another artist, presumably
in a similar
condition of benignity,
arriving home
very late, softly unlocks
the street door,
goes up stairs, very
softly enters his bedroom,
and undresses&mdash;very
softly, so as
not to disturb his
wife, and finally
creeps into bed&mdash;likewise
very softly
and gently; to be
startled by his better
half asking him&mdash;very
softly and gently,
no doubt&mdash;if he is
aware that he has got
into bed with his
top-hat on!</p>

<p>One member always raises a hearty laugh
by his imitation of a brother member&mdash;a
man of the greatest good humour, but of
third-rate ability&mdash;who, debating with another
artist on the great Whistler question, thus
sums the matter up: "If Whistler is right,
then you, and me, and Michael Angelo are
all wrong."</p>

<p>Sometimes in this way one may pick up
some interesting anecdotes of the men of a
past generation. Holland, the famous landscape
painter, who was once a member, used
to have many anecdotes about Turner. On
one occasion he was sitting near to him at
dinner, when a lady observed to him that she
admired his pictures very much, although
she could not say that she understood them.
"Don't you wish you had the brains to do
so?" replied Turner&mdash;a little rudely, it must
be confessed.</p>

<p>Members take it in turns to "set" the
models, who generally pose for an hour,
then take a short rest, and afterwards sit for
another hour. They are
placed on a raised platform
under a top light,
the artists being ranged
in a semicircle facing
them. No one is allowed
to speak to the model
except the member
whose duty it is to set
him or her, and the utmost
silence is enjoined.
Some of the models take
great interest in the work
of the artists, and like to
see what they have made
them look like. Many
curious characters are
found amongst them,
and the stories of their
humours and oddities are
endless and infinitely
diverting.</p>

<p>Not the least amusing
is that of the man who
had posed for apostles
and saints so long that he could not be
induced to sit for a common coster.</p>

<p>"It would be such a come-down, sir," he
said, with a rueful countenance.
There is also a
story&mdash;possibly apocryphal&mdash;of
a model who
had got beyond sitting
deploring his changed estate,
in that he who had
sat for "lords and cardinals"
was reduced to
"wet-nursing a kangaroo"
(having obtained employment
at the Zoo).</p>

<p>But perhaps the best
story of a model is one
that used to be told by
Sir Edwin Landseer. It
concerned a man named
Bishop, a man who will
be remembered by nearly
all the older generation
of artists. Bishop was a
bit of a favourite with
Landseer, and often sat
for him. Once when so
employed he thus addressed the famous
animal painter: "Sir Ed'n," said he, "I sees
from the papers as you of'n dines with Her
Gracious Majesty at Buckingham
Palace, and as
you gets on very well wi'
her. Now, Sir Ed'n, I've
been a-thinking&mdash;if you
wouldn't mind the trouble&mdash;you
might do me and
my misses a very good
turn&mdash;a very good turn,
you might. You know,
Sir Ed'n, my misses is a
rare good washer, and if,
next time you dines with
Her Majesty&mdash;just when
you gets cosy like, arter
dinner&mdash;if you would
just pervail on her to give
my misses her washing,
it would set us up, it
would. Now, Sir Ed'n,
you'll pard'n me for
a-mentionin' of it, but
if you could do that for
us, we'd take it very kind
like."</p>

<p>It is not stated whether the request was
ever put to Her Majesty.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Lady Dilke</span> (<i>n&eacute;e</i>
Emilia Frances
Strong), daughter
of Major Henry
Strong, H.E.I.C.S.,
was born at Ilfracombe in
1842. She was educated by
Miss Bodwick, sister of the
celebrated African traveller,
and received much friendly
teaching in drawing from Mr.
Mulready, R.A. She married
first, in 1862, the Rev. Mark
Pattison, Rector of Lincoln
College, Oxford (who died on
July 30th, 1884); and secondly,
in 1885, the Right Hon. Sir Charles
Wentworth Dilke, Bart. Lady Dilke was
long a writer in the <i>Saturday</i> and <i>Westminster
Reviews</i>, and afterwards, on the
foundation of the <i>Academy</i>, she edited the
Art section for one or two years, and also
supplied original articles during that time.
In 1879, Lady Dilke published a work in
two volumes illustrated by herself, and
entitled "The Renaissance of Art in
France." In 1881 she wrote a biography
of Sir Frederick Leighton for the series of
"Modern Artists," edited by Mr. Dumas;
and in 1882 she lectured at the Birmingham
and Midland Institute on "The
Industrial Policy of Colbert." In 1884
she published in French, through the
Librairie de l'Art, a monograph on
Claude. Lady Dilke subsequently published
"The Shrine of Death," a volume of stories,
in 1886, and "Art in the Modern State," in
1888. In subsequent
years she contributed
several stories to the
<i>Universal Review</i>, and
wrote in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> and the <i>New
Review</i> on Trade Unions
for Women, in which she
takes a deep interest.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Oxford Union Society is
one of the two most important
debating clubs in England, the
other being the sister Society
at Cambridge. It has been
estimated that nearly a fifth of
the present House of Commons, and a very
considerable number of the House of Lords,
have aired their early efforts in the great
debating hall in New Inn Hall Street. It
might not be uninteresting to our readers to
know something of the school in which so
many distinguished speakers have been
trained.</p>

<p>As the United Debating Society, its
foundation dates from 1823; but in 1825
it was broken up to exclude turbulent
members, and reconstituted under its present
name. It is nominally a social club, with
reading, writing, billiard, dining, and smoking
rooms, and a good library of 25,000 volumes.
But its true importance lies in the debates
which are held once a week in term time.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE DEBATING HALL&mdash;OXFORD UNION.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by C. Court Cole, Oxford.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The new debating hall is an exceedingly
fine room, lit with the electric light, and
decorated with the portraits of the distinguished
men
who have filled
the President's
chair, and presented
by themselves.
There are
two of Mr. Gladstone,
one as the
"rising hope of
those stern and unbending
Tories,"
and one as the
great leader of the
Liberals of England.</p>

<p>At one end of
the hall three
chairs of carved
oak are raised on
a da&iuml;s, the central
one higher than
either of the
others. Here sits
the President,
with the Treasurer
and Librarian on
either side of him,
and the Secretary at a table at his feet. An
electric bell is fixed to the President's chair,
with which he warns speakers that their allotted
time is drawing to a close. Members
have been known to speak for twenty minutes
without launching into their subject, so the
bell is not without its use.</p>

<p>The gallery is reserved for visitors, chiefly
ladies, and is crowded on the night of an important
debate. It has a reputation of being
unsafe, and whenever it is unusually full,
someone is sure to rise in private business
and ask if any steps have been taken to
strengthen it. The alarm of the fair occupants
is only allayed by the assurance of its
complete stability.</p>

<p>The Society consists of over 900 subscribing
and 20,000 life members. Its officers
are elected by ballot, and canvassing is
strictly forbidden on pain of a heavy fine.
It seems, however, to be a disputed point
as to what constitutes canvassing. There
is considerable keenness at election time,
which occurs every term. The Librarian
and Junior Treasurer hold office for a
year; the President, Secretary, and members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
of Standing and Library Committees, for a
term only.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 621px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE LARGE LIBRARY&mdash;OXFORD UNION.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by C. Court Cole, Oxford.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>As the money which the Society receives
and spends is no small sum, it has been thought
advisable to have as a permanent Senior
Treasurer one who does not come and go as
undergraduates do. So the &pound;3,000 odd,
which comes in yearly to the funds, is
watched over by a Don. He is, however,
only a servant of the Society, and has no
power of himself. Nominally politics have
nothing to do with the voting, and the
officers are often men of different views, but
in reality the political clubs of the 'Varsity
exercise no mean influence on the ballot.
However, popularity and distinction are still
of the most weight, though it was said that
one club "ran" the elections for several
years, and it is curious to note that the last-elected
President, Librarian, and Junior
Treasurer all belong to the same club.</p>

<p>The conduct of debates is as follows: The
names of four members, generally speakers
who are known to have some ability, are
printed on the bills that are posted throughout
the 'Varsity. It is etiquette for these four
and also for the officers of the Society to wear
evening dress. Only these four have a
certainty of a place in the debate. The first
two may speak for twenty-five minutes, and
the other two for twenty minutes apiece.
Those who follow have only fifteen minutes,
and have to jump
to their feet to
catch the President's
eye. Some
who have prepared
speeches
never get a chance
of firing them off.</p>

</div>

<p>Before the true
work of the evening
begins, private
business is discussed.
This is
the recognised
hour of amusement,
and members
can achieve
no small reputation
by excellence
in the asking of
ridiculous questions.
Many of
these are personal.
A young earl, who
occupies the President's
throne, is
chaffed about a
certain celebrated pill because the maker's
name resembles his own. The Treasurer
is worried about new billiard balls, accommodation
for dogs, and his portrait in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
the <i>Lady's Pictorial</i> when he came of age;
the Librarian about the contents of some
strange book; the Secretary about his handwriting.
Lately the World's Fair at Chicago
asked the Union to send two of its members
to the Show, but stipulated that they must
be of the "highest moral and social standing."
The discussion lasted several evenings
as to who was fit, what the delegates would
be required to do, and what they would be
paid. It was finally decided that no one
person could combine the two qualities.
Such discussions as these occupy the lighter
moments of the Society.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/i_504.jpg" width="440" height="628" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then the debate of the evening begins:
sometimes it is good, sometimes bad&mdash;more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
often indifferent. Occasionally there is an
orator of unusual brilliance and power, and
then the hall is crowded; but as the evening
wears on members drop out one by one, and
someone moves that the question be now
put.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 504px;">
<img src="images/i_505.jpg" width="504" height="649" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Occasionally distinguished visitors are
asked to speak, and then more than ordinary
interest is shown. Last year, Lord Winchilsea
joined in a debate on the state of
agriculture, and spoke for over an hour. He
met with hearty support, but also candid
criticism, and he defended his scheme with
great good humour and ability. Thus the
undergraduates have all the advantage of
discussing leading questions with recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
authorities on the subject, and the speaker
has the opportunity of influencing an audience
that is larger than it looks, and which is
certainly one of more than average intellect.
It is, moreover, considered to be no small
honour to be invited to speak at the Oxford
Union. And politicians find it a profitable
way of spreading their views. The undergraduates
disperse and influence many districts,
and many, in a few years, will be
themselves members of Parliament. We are
able to give a reduced facsimile of two pages
of signatures of old members who met for
the 50th Anniversary Dinner, among which
we find many of the most famous men now
living.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>PAGE FROM THE MINUTE-BOOK, IN THE HANDWRITING OF MR. GLADSTONE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Almost every subject under the sun has
been dissected in this Society. The Home
Rule Bill met with the fate it was afterwards
destined to receive at the hands of the Lords.
In some ways the result of the voting in the
Union is not entirely without importance. It
shows the current of thought among the
future politicians of England.</p>

<p>The style of oratory has been condemned
by outsiders as unsound. Great importance
is attached to brilliant epigrams and incisive
phraseology. Mere solidity and strength of
argument produce more yawns than applause.
So it is said that the real object of debate is
lost sight of, and that flashy oratory takes the
place of sound reasoning. There is some
truth in this, and probably the most popular
speakers at the Union will not become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
leaders of Parliament. But, after all, it is in
speaking and not in thinking that young men
need practice. When they are older they
will think more and speak less.</p>

<p>The Presidency is one of
the most highly-prized distinctions
at the 'Varsity, and
one which a man may well
be proud of in after life.
And this is not to be
wondered at when we find among the list of
those who have held the office the names of
Mr. Gladstone, Cardinal Manning, Archbishop
Tait, Lord Selborne, the Marquis of
Dufferin and Ava, the late Dukes of Cleveland
and Newcastle, the late Earl Beauchamp,
Viscount Sherbrooke, Lord Coleridge, Mr.
Goschen, the Right Hon. H. Asquith,
Samuel Wilberforce, the late Bishop of
Durham, the Bishops of Peterborough and
Chichester, and a host of lesser celebrities,
such as deans, Under Secretaries of State,
heads of colleges and public schools, judges,
etc. Such a list of ex-Presidents could hardly
be found in any debating society in the world.
The Oxford Union Society is justly proud of
them.</p>

<p>The preceding page from the minute-book
kept by Mr. Gladstone when Secretary
is extremely interesting. It will be noted
that the motion was introduced by Mr. Gladstone
himself and carried by a majority of
one vote, Mr. Gladstone being careful to note
that the circumstance was greeted with
"tremendous cheering" and "repeated
cheers."</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;CAMBRIDGE.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By St. J. Basil Wynne Willson, M.A.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_507.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1886, in a speech made at
the opening of the new buildings,
the late Duke of Clarence
said: "The Union affords, not
only opportunities for social
intercourse, but it is of great
service for reading and study, and in many
cases has given the first lessons to men who
have afterwards ranked among our greatest
orators." It is largely a comfortable club,
but primarily it is a debating society, and it
is as such that its
history is of interest.</p>

<p>To discover the
origin of the institution
we must
go far back to the
year 1815, when,
in the big room of
the Lion Hotel in
Petty Cury, three
earlier societies
combined in one
Union. The large,
bare room, with
its tables dinted
by the "firing" of
glasses at many a
Masonic dinner,
forms a striking
contrast to the fine
buildings with
handsome apartments and club-land luxuries
in which the present generation revels.
Founded by men known afterwards as Lord
Langdale, the Hon. Sir E. Hall Alderson,
the Right Hon. Sir F. Pollock, and the
Hon. and Very Rev. H. Pakenham, the
Society was happy in its early auspices,
and often since in the Presidential chair
have sat men who shed on it such lustre
that they now draw some light therefrom.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE DEBATING HALL&mdash;CAMBRIDGE UNION.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by Messrs. Stearn, Cambridge.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>After a short sojourn at the Lion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
Society moved to the present A. D. C. Theatre,
and in 1850 migrated again to a disused
Wesleyan chapel in Green Street, where now
is heard the click of billiard balls instead
of the voice of preacher or orator. In
thrifty years a Building Fund was amassed,
and in 1866, Charles W. Dilke being President,
the bulk of the present buildings was erected
at a cost of &pound;10,700. Since that time there
have been added the laboratory block in
1882, and the north wing, containing the
library, in 1885. The illustrations must be
left to describe the appearance and size of
the chief rooms, of which successive Vice-Presidents
have increased the comfort and
splendour, electric light and a luncheon-room
being amongst the latest additions.</p>

<p>The library contains 25,000 volumes,
covering a large range of literature, but
omitting three of Zola's works. However,
"to provide a library and reading-room" is
only the secondary object of the Union: its
chief design always has been and is "to hold
debates," and it is for oratorical merit that
the President, Vice-President, Secretary, and
Committee of six are terminally elected. It
is as a debating society that it has a claim
to fame. That the elect of the Union are
often also the elect of the outer world, the
following account will, I think, show.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE SMOKING ROOM&mdash;CAMBRIDGE UNION.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo, by Messrs. Stearn, Cambridge.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1816 W. Whewell, a late Master of
Trinity, was President. His was a stirring
reign on account of the strained relations
between the Union and the University
authorities, who seem to have maintained a
paternal government in those days, looking
with suspicious
eyes on the young
innovators who
met once a week
to discuss men
and manners.
During a debate,
on March 24th,
1817, on the condition
of the
Army, a dramatic
and almost tragic
event took place.
Enter on a
sudden the Proctors,
attended by
bull-dogs: dim
light, slow music
and many excursions
and alarums,
whilst the President
in a
stern voice bids
strangers withdraw. The intruders demand
the dispersion of the meeting and the
termination of discussions. The result was
that a deputation was sent to the Vice-Chancellor
to bear him a remonstrance,
"consistently with perfect obedience to
University discipline." The deputation
"believed that the Vice-Chancellor interfered,
owing to the circumstance of having received
a letter from one of the members, stating that
the studies of himself and of his friends had
been checked and their prospects blighted by
attention to the Society." The Vice-Chancellor
curtly replied: "I do not think it
necessary or, perhaps, proper to return any
answer to this statement. I had considered
the matter fully in my own mind."</p>

<p>Thus the Society was crushed for a time,
but in 1821 re-asserted itself, on the understanding
that no questions of theology or of
politics except of a date previous to 1800
should be discussed. The result was that contemporary
politics were debated under a thin
disguise of similar circumstances in the past.</p>

<p>Macaulay and Praed were frequent speakers.
The former upheld Hampden, Burke, and
the study of fiction; whilst the latter opposed
him on the subject of Burke, but showed
admiration for the conduct of Napoleon&mdash;of
course, "previous to 1800." They both declared
against armed interference in France
in 1792, Charles Austin and Alex. Cockburn
being on the other side. On this occasion
Macaulay made a speech, of which the late
Lord Lytton wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The greatest display of eloquence that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
ever witnessed at that club was made by a
man some years our senior, the now renowned
Lord Macaulay, and it still lingers in my
recollection as the most heart-stirring effort
of that true oratory that it has ever been my
lot to hear, saving perhaps a speech delivered
by Mr. O'Connell to an immense crowd in
the open air. Macaulay, in point of power,
passion, and effect, never equalled that speech
in his best days in the House of Commons."</p>

<p>E. Strutt (Lord Belper), Macaulay, and
Cockburn all supported the reform of the
Commons at the end of the last century.
Cockburn and Lytton prevailed on the
House to carry a motion "that a systematic
opposition to the measures of an administration
is beneficial
to the country."
A great debate of
this period had for
its subject "that
the Constitution
of America is
more favourable
to the liberties of
the people than
that of England."
Macaulay, Praed,
and Cockburn approved,
and were
carrying the House
with them, when
up rose Lytton so
eloquent and persuasive
that he
won his case for
England by 109
votes to 37. In
Mr. Skipper's
pamphlet may be
found the following interesting description of
the Society in "an unpublished squib,"
written at this time by Praed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Passing on, we come to the era of Trench,
Sunderland, Monckton Milnes (late Lord
Houghton), S. Walpole, and Arthur Hallam.
This is mainly a literary period. Although
Tennyson was a member of the club, he does
not seem to have taken part with his friend
in any debates.</p>

<p>Milnes and Hallam both spoke in contention
of Wordsworth's superiority to Byron,
but a majority of twenty-seven gave the palm
to "Childe Harold's" author. Trench
(Archbishop) propounded the original
question: "Will Mr. Coleridge's Poem of
the 'Ancient Mariner' or Mr. Martin's Act
tend most to prevent cruelty to animals?"</p>

<p>There is an episode of this time that has a
peculiar interest. It was, as the late Cardinal
Manning described it, "a passage of arms got
up by the Eton men of the two Unions."</p>

</div>

<p>On March 26th, 1829, Cambridge sent
to Oxford a deputation consisting of Monckton
Milnes, Arthur Hallam, and Sunderland,
whom Milnes, when Lord Houghton, once
declared to be "the greatest orator I think
I ever heard, who only lives in the memory
of his University." The relative merits of
Byron and Shelley were the subject of
discussion.</p>

<p>The Cambridge men were entertained by
Sir Francis Doyle and "a young student named
Gladstone." S. Wilberforce was in the chair.
Our champions spoke for the claims of Shelley,
and so telling was their oratory that Oxford
sat silent and awestruck, until a young man
with a slight, boyish figure arose and turned
the whole tide of discussion by a speech of
much grace and eloquence. His name was
Manning. He has himself described the
occasion: "I can, however, well remember
the irruption of the three Cambridge orators.
We Oxford men were precise, orderly, and
morbidly afraid of excess in word or manner.
The Cambridge oratory came in like a flood
into a mill-pond. Both Monckton Milnes
and Arthur Hallam took us aback by the
boldness and freedom of their manner. But
I remember the effect of Sunderland's declamation
and action to this day. It had never
been seen or heard before among us&mdash;we
cowered like birds and ran like sheep. I
acknowledge that we were utterly routed."
"The Oxford men didn't seem to know who
Shelley was; they thought he was Shenstone,"
was a remark that Lord Houghton once
made to Mr. Oscar Browning, my informant.</p>

<p>In an interesting little book, called "Conversations
in Cambridge," published in 1836,
there are preserved some criticisms of the
Union of the period.</p>

<p>"The Union&mdash;a word requiring no explanation
to any member of the University&mdash;reached
an elevation in those days which it is
not likely soon to recover. Macaulay with his
flashes of vigorous imagination; Praed with
his graceful irony and poetical fancy; and
many others whose names live in the memory
of their companions, imparted an unusual
charm to its meetings."</p>

<p>But, better still, there are some fragments of
speeches made by Macaulay, in debates on
Cromwell, Strafford, and Milton. The following
is an extract from the speech on the
Protector:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I stand not here, sir, to-night, as the
advocate or panegyrist of that melancholy
domestic tragedy, which was presented before
this afflicted nation in that tempestuous
season. But, sir, I would ask: was there no
provocation, no exaction, no insult to the
dignity of man; no invasion of the sanctity
of a Briton's fireside? Sir, the grave of
Hampden has a voice: let it answer for me!
Tyranny had dashed its mailed hand upon
the mouth of every freeman; the lifeblood
of the laws was drained out by unnumbered
wounds."</p>

<p>About 1848, Mr. Childers, Sir W. V.
Harcourt, and Sir Fitzjames Stephen were
contemporaries. The present Chancellor of
the Exchequer spoke against the ballot, and
with Sir Fitzjames Stephen opposed a
motion that asked the House to declare
that "Mr. Cobden and his party represent
the rising good sense of the people." In
1855, H. Montague Butler and J. E. Gorst
were respectively President and Treasurer.
Gorst gained the chair in 1857. The next
most interesting group of Union "lights" is
that which includes George O. Trevelyan,
H. C. Raikes, Oscar Browning, and H. and
A. Sidgwick.</p>

<p>Mr. O. Browning says: "I remember in
'56 sitting in the room in Green Street
('cavernous tavernous' as Lord Houghton
called it), thinking of nothing in particular,
when I suddenly awoke and heard a pleasing
voice saying some of the cleverest things I
ever heard. It was G. O. Trevelyan. When
his speeches were prepared they were
brilliant. He was the hero of the great
'smoking-room question,' and headed the
opposition to the scheme. In an excited
peroration he produced a black clay pipe
in one hand and some red tape in the
other, declaring them to be the symbols of
the parties, and then proceeded dramatically
to snip the red tape to pieces. It was Tre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>velyan
who was compelled to move the
suggestion-book temporarily, for at that time
it was the receptacle of homeless jokes,
doggerel verses, and scurrilous remarks, of
which 'You rib-nosed baboon,' and 'Why
not make Raikes Lord Mayor?' are
examples."</p>

<p>In that brilliant periodical of one number,
the <i>Bear</i>, Trevelyan has burlesqued one of
his own speeches amongst others. The
motion is to repair the Society's clock.</p>

<p>"This is no measure for the purpose of
pampering an over-fed clerk, or stuffing our
shelves with Puseyite novels. But let them
not think they have gained the confidence of
the House. <i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</i>.
(Loud cheers from a Freshman, who seems to
recognise the quotation.) Shall we trust
our clock to a committee
reeking with
Ruskin? To an embryo
architectural
society?... Whom
shall we dare trust?
There they will sit,
grinning at their new
clock&mdash;(a cry of
'Question'). Question?&mdash;(and
the
speaker turned to the
Treasurer, who was
lolling alone on the
opposite sofa). There
you sit compact,
united&mdash;mouthing
and blustering about
Tennyson and Carlyle,
and nobody cries
'Question'; and if
he does, he is snubbed
by a partial President.
(Great confusion, and
cries of 'Sit down,'
'Chair.')"</p>

<p>Passing reluctantly
over Lord E. Fitzmaurice, A. S. Wilkins, A. W.
Verrall, J. E. C. Welldon, R. C. Lehmann, we
come, in 1880, to an interesting figure&mdash;J. K.
Stephen, who re-appeared in Union life in
recent years, and scribbled off some of his
Calverleian lines whilst sitting on the Committee
bench. On one occasion in his
later years he came into the House when
one of many brilliant sons of a brilliant ex-President
had proposed nationalization of
land. At the first opportunity he rose, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have not heard the speech of the
honourable proposer, and I am very glad I
have not heard it. All I am come down
here to do is to deny that there can be any
connection between his premisses and his
conclusions: conclusions which can only be
reached by a total want of knowledge, based
upon an absolute ignorance of facts."</p>

<p>J. K. Stephen made many great speeches
shortly before his death, and an eminent
M.P., Q.C., remarked, when he heard him,
that after Gladstone he was the greatest
orator in the country.</p>

<p>Another incident of late years is worth
recording as evidence of the dangers of
debate. During a big debate on the opium
question, a prominent anti-opiumist was
speaking against the traffic to a crowded
House. Whilst discussing the treaties with
China, he noticed a man opposite vehemently
dissenting, and at
last remarked, "I
don't know who the
hon. member is, but
I can quote the authority
of Sir Thomas
Wade, who made the
treaties." After him
the "gentleman opposite"
arose, and,
revealing himself as
Sir Thomas Wade,
proceeded to make
much mincemeat.</p>

<p>Owing to pressure
of space, many well-known
ex-Presidents
and officers have been
passed by unnoticed:
C. Rann Kennedy
(Pr. 1832), Lord
Henniker (Pr. 1834),
Sir W. F. Pollock
(Pr. 1836), Bishop
Ellicott (Pr. 1839),
Prof. C. Babington
(Pr. 1845), Lord R.
A. Cross (Pr. 1845), Rev. Ll. Davies
(Pr. 1847), Hon. A. Gordon (Lord Stanmore)
(Pr. 1849), Henry Fawcett (Pr. 1855), Dr.
Henry Jackson (Pr. 1864), and a long list of
others, statesmen, clergy, scholars, lawyers,
whose early development it would be interesting
to trace.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to publish
some reminiscences most kindly sent by a distinguished
ex-President, Sir Charles Dilke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If somebody of the time were to talk to
me about it (the Union), I have no doubt
my reminiscences would flow. At the present
moment, with the exception of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
disrespectful allusions in Prince Florestan of
Monaco.... I remember nothing except the
terrible noises that my friends used to make
over my head when I was President in the old
room in Green Street. I often threatened to
have the gallery cleared, but as I had not the
physical force at my command to sweep them
out, they used to sit on the ends of the tables
with disastrous effect. The first speech in
the Union which I remember was one
when I was a Freshman, by Mr. George Trevelyan.
He declared amid a tremendous storm
of cheers, in reference to the Government
of the United States: 'That Union, Mr.
President&mdash;that Union has no Building
Fund.' The Cambridge Union in those
days possessed a handsome Building Fund,
which I forthwith spent, and the result of the
spending of which, and the borrowing of
much more, is visible in the present building."</p>

<p>Another old President (who wishes to be
anonymous) says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In '57 or '58 Trevelyan began to make a
reputation, and perhaps still more the
American, Everett, with a really remarkable
force which he has still.... Fawcett
spoke often; harshly
and loud, but very
ably. Vernon Lushington
was forcible,
but not suave enough.
Gorst (now Sir J.)
spoke well, but without
much power.
Ernest Noel (late
member for Dumfries)
once or twice delighted
us with a clear
and cultured fluency
that we were not accustomed
to. It shows
the alteration of the
times that a sort of
thrill of horror ran
round the House when
in one debate he
actually mentioned
that he was not a
member of the Church
of England.... We
used <i>not</i> to imitate the
ways of the House of
Commons very closely, with the idea that it
might be bad taste, and that we had traditions
of our own to be proud of."</p>

<p>Forty-five members of the Society are in
the House of Lords, including the Prince of
Wales and the two Archbishops, and 58 in
the Commons. Our present-day debates, held
once a week, are dignified and orderly.
They last for about two and a half hours,
the proposer and opposer occupying usually
an hour between them. The private-business
meetings are generally more scenic, especially
when we discuss Zola or finance. A noticeable
feature is the number of Orientals who
take part, and a very able, eloquent part too,
in our debates. One has risen to the Chair.
The future historian will be at little trouble
for material, for the <i>Cambridge Review</i> and
the <i>Granta</i>, in different styles, record
each debate and change. Out of 237
Presidents, Trinity has provided 132 and
St. John's 29.</p>

<p>The members of the Society are increasing,
and between 400 and 500 new members are
enrolled annually. There is no exclusiveness
and all types of University life are
represented.</p>

<p>Our relations with
our younger Oxford
sister are excellent.
From term to term
there is an interchange
of speakers
between the two clubs.</p>

<p>In conclusion it
may be said that, great
as the past has been,
the future should be
none the less brilliant.
The usefulness of
such an institution is
obvious. In 1994 it
may be that the names
that will be honoured
in an article in a
flourishing <i>Strand</i>
will be those of men
whose promise is
now so great, and
whose friendship so
many of us value now
so highly.</p>

thinking of the words instead of

glowing description of a young girl's

<p><span class="smcap">Interviewer</span>:
You were born&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: Oh! I
see. Certainly,
certainly&mdash;but&mdash;it's
a long speech&mdash;a
speech, however,
I don't think
I shall ever forget.
We always remember
ourselves, eh?
and forget O.P.,
which means other
people, or opposite
prompter. (<i>Sits
in armchair</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>
<i>of fireplace</i>.) I
was born in
Liverpool on the
23rd of March,
1841. My father
was a doctor&mdash;he
only died a year or two ago. My mother
gave me my first lessons, until at ten years
of age I was sent to school at Sandgate.
There I took a great liking for drawing&mdash;particularly
for building castles in the air!
I imbibed a love for the stage before I knew
the value of words, and used to revel in
acting to myself before a looking-glass. I
left Sandgate when I was about twelve and
went to St. Andrews, and there I was the
cause of public censure, as it was said I was
demoralizing all the boys on account of my
strong theatrical tastes. Major Playfair&mdash;the
grandfather of Arthur Playfair, the actor&mdash;had
a private theatre near my school, and
I need hardly say how I used to revel in
being permitted to attend there. But it
came to an end at last. I used to write
very bloodthirsty dramas, and myself and
companions used to play them in our bedrooms
by candle-light. We were, however,
discovered, and the curtain fell with a thud.
I was at St. Andrews for two years. I took
a prize for Latin, and always those for
elocution. I ran away from St. Andrews
once, but having no money in my pocket I
went back the next day. I remained there
until I was fifteen, when I was sent to
Germany&mdash;to Neuwied first, and Bonn afterwards.
You would scarcely credit it, but
there I became a very dreamy fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interviewer</span>: Dreamy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: Yes, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
became quite a religious enthusiast, and
founded a Church.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Interviewer</span> <i>surprised&mdash;but he must save
his energies to be more so later</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span> (<i>solemnly</i>):
Whilst I used to play with my companions, I
was always much impressed by a long-legged,
lanky-looking fellow, who used to walk up
and down the playground with his eyes on
his boots. I got in with him, found he
belonged to a well-known Wesleyan family,
and we founded a Church to reform the
boys. The masters lent us a room, and
starting with half-a-dozen we ultimately got
twenty-five lads. When my Wesleyan friend
left I became head of the Church. In
the college was the son of a celebrated
divine in London&mdash;whom we will call B.
He was a very bad lot, using very bad
language. One day he asked me to let him
join the Church. I hesitated. Told him I'd
take a fortnight to decide. I did. It came
to my turn to preach. B. was present. My
sermon was directed to him. After it was all
over he came to me and assured me he
was a changed man. I was delighted. He
grasped me by the hand and said he should
like to preach on the following Sunday!
I assured him that it was the rule for only
four or five of us to preach. He thought an
exception ought to be made in his case.
I would not hear of it. "Look here," he
said, "won't you let me preach?" "No,
I could not." "Do you mean it?" he asked.
"I do." "Without a doubt, Wyndham?"
"I am immovable."
"Then," he
said, "go to &mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

theatre. Got to Cabinet Theatre, King's

first met William Blakeley, an admirable
comedian, who in those days was a slim,
thin, dashing young fellow. I was not
long in making up my mind. I would go
in for tragedy, I was so impressed with
Barry Sullivan; though I fancy on looking
back that Charles Mathews attracted me
most, although I never dreamed of becoming
a light comedian. What a voice Charley
had, how perfect his every movement! The
marvellous charm of that man was his
extreme naturalness. How well I remember

him come out! No one who ever saw
Charley could forget him. Dear old

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: At one of the
Ash Wednesday performances by Cole at the
Haymarket Theatre. I played <i>Captain
Murphy Macguire</i> in "The Serious Family,"
and John Clayton was the <i>Charles Tarcus</i>.
I often played with Clayton. He and I were
in the cast of "Dearer Than Life," at the
Queen's Theatre, in 1868, together with Toole,
Irving, Lionel Brough, and Henrietta Hodson
(Mrs. Labouchere). I paid a guinea to play
Macguire, and it was worth more to me, for
I was soon after playing with Buckstone,
and then made my first dash on at the
Royalty at &pound;1 a week, when Ellen Terry and
I used to play lovers. But one of my great
desires was to play <i>Rover</i> in "Wild Oats."
I made up my mind to do it as soon as I
saw Phelps in the part at Sadler's Wells.
I had &pound;30, and meeting another young
fellow with a similar sum, we began to
negotiate for the Strand Theatre, then under
the management of Mr. Payne. But our
hopes were crushed, as a slight barrier
cropped up in the way of rent. Payne
wanted &pound;60 a week rent, and three months
in advance. By this time I was ashamed of
myself, although I had an offer of twelve
shillings a week at the Theatre Royal,
Preston&mdash;which, probably, I never should
have got! I wrote to my father. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
somewhat wroth when I told him my theatrical
desires. He said: "Well, take your
diploma, and I won't interfere." I accepted
the bargain, finished my medical studentship,
went to Dublin&mdash;took my diploma. I had
almost abandoned the idea of going on to the
stage, and 1863 found me on my way to
America to the war. I left with &pound;9 in my
pocket! It was the dad's suggestion I should
go, but I believe
he did it with a
breaking heart.
Look at that!
(<i>Takes a massive
gold ring set with

<span class="smcap">Interviewer</span>.)
Why, the old fellow
came over to
America whilst I
was there. When
he was leaving
the docks, he
threw this, wrapped
up in a piece
of paper, on to
the quay. My
eyes were fixed
on my father.
There was he,
making frantic
gesticulations
and pointing. I
thought the piece
of paper a greenback,
and refused
to pick it up. At
last he became
almost frantic in
his anxiety. I
picked up the
paper, and there
was that ring in
it. The old fellow
went away happy.
This diamond
and sapphire ring
was given to me
by the Czar. Not
a bad ring, eh? Look at it. (<span class="smcap">Interviewer</span>

<p>"The piece was
an adaptation of
Ouida's 'Idalia.'
I was playing the
hero, <i>Hugh Stoneleigh</i>;
a young
actor named
Charles was
<i>Victor Vane</i>; Miss
Herbert (long
since retired) was
<i>Idalia</i>; and
Henry Irving was
the villain of the
play, <i>Count Falcon</i>.
In those
days, by-the-bye,
managers would
insist upon casting
me for the
virtuous heroes,
and Irving for
the vicious ones, although our proclivities
in no way justified the selection. But
what a charming villain Irving was: the
only actor I have ever seen who has been
able to make villainy on the stage appear as
it should appear&mdash;lovable. But to resume:
The opening scene was a rocky defile, in
which I was suddenly attacked by Irving,
and left for dead. The stage-manager had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
outshone himself in the production of a
grandly impressive scene, in which the
demands of realism were observed by the
introduction of a natural waterfall: descending
from the flies at the side, passing under a
massive bridge, and rushing wildly and
obliquely across the stage. It was certainly
a gorgeous scene; an inspiring one, bound
to elicit uproarious approval. Well, on the
first night it did, and during the rest of the
evening that waterfall was never forgotten.
I told you it was supposed to dash under a
massive bridge (which, by-the-bye, sloped
down towards the footlights, in full view of
the audience); but stage-managers propose,
and waterfalls dispose. It was its first
appearance on any stage, and, like most
beginners, it wanted to do too much: it not
only dashed under the bridge, but it trickled
over the bridge; and, on its passage across
the stage, it oozed from its proper channel,
in several independent little rivulets, down
towards the footlights. Wherever that inexperienced
water went, it left the stage
slippery. Thunders of applause greeted the
enthusiastic d&eacute;butant, and all the time the
traitor was preparing for the annihilation of
his brother artists. Gracefully down the
bridge came F. Charles. He touched the
slippery part of the bridge, threw his arms
out wildly, away went his cloak into the
torrent, and&mdash;well, he sat down. With
dramatic instinct in every nerve of his body,
firmly entered, half a minute afterwards,
Henry Irving; looked about him warily;
then strode down the bridge&mdash;you know the
stride&mdash;till he also reached the fatal spot,
threw his arms wildly round, and&mdash;well, he
sat down. Need I tell you that the awe
of the situation was fading? Now came my
turn. Standing on a platform behind the scene
from the commencement, I had seen what
had happened to my two friends; so,
stepping gingerly down the bridge, I arrived
on the stage without sitting down, had my
encounter with the two ruffians, escaped
from them, had
run wildly up the
bridge again to receive
the shot from
<i>Falcon's</i> pistol, and
had fallen, according
to stage-manager's
instructions, a
foot or so below
the treacherous
spot. On came
<i>Idalia</i>&mdash;she had
heard the shot.
'Ah! a body on
the bridge!' She
runs down, recognises
me&mdash;'Great
heavens, 'tis he!'&mdash;rushes
further
down, reaches the
fatal place, away go
her arms, and&mdash;well,
she sat down:
the folds of her
dress falling over
me and completely
hiding me from the
view of the audience.
That was the
end of the act&mdash;it
was a powerful one.
We had all done our
level best, but the
waterfall had scored
the most.</p>

</div>

<p>"The next scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
was a simple drawing-room. The waterfall
was gone, thank Heaven, and we could
rely upon ourselves. The act began. It
was interesting and dramatic: a powerful
scene between Miss Herbert and Irving&mdash;accusation
of murder, defiance, vengeance
for my death&mdash;all very startling; sufficiently
so to drive for the time the slippery knave
from everybody's mind. A great scene,
well acted and well received; everything
going splendidly, and an effect in store
bound to please the audience.</p>

<p>"The hero is
not dead, for he
suddenly appears;
appears,
as a hero always
does, at the back
of the stage; great
applause at his
resuscitation;
Miss Herbert
backs with joy
and surprise right
to the footlights,
and I prepare to
rush towards her;
success is in our
grasp; the audience
are in splendid
humour;
spite of all difficulties,
we have
triumphed. Alas,
the vanity of
human hopes!
The waterfall was
lying in wait for
me. I told you
the scene was a
drawing-room;
but I did not tell
you that it was
an Italian one&mdash;consequently,
that the carpet
covered only the
centre of the
stage. Across it I madly rushed towards my
faithful love. '<i>Idalia</i>,' I exclaimed, 'I never
expected to see you again!'&mdash;reached one
of those rivulets, that had trickled in exactly
the same direction I was going&mdash;reached it
unknowingly&mdash;slipped, and&mdash;well, <i>I</i> sat
down.</p>

how the second act terminated in convulsions

Well, after playing about for some years,
at last came a moment when I seemed
to be on the horns of a dilemma. I had
just advanced beyond the position of a stock
actor, and hadn't achieved any particular
individual reputation&mdash;that is, I felt unless
I adopted some special line managers
wouldn't offer me engagements. One morning&mdash;I
was playing at Brighton&mdash;at breakfast
I had three telegrams in succession. One
read: "Would you accept an engagement
at a West-end theatre to manage it yourself?"
A second&mdash;from T. E. Smale:
"Would you like a theatre in London?
I can find money for it." And a third
from Alexander Henderson: "Could you
open at Criterion in 'Brighton' next Monday?"
This seemed direct. I rushed to
town. Henderson said: "Rare chance. If
open next Monday&mdash;can have theatre rent
free!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interviewer</span>: Of course&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: Yes&mdash;I
went! Played a month. Went to Paris.
Returned at
Easter. Opened
in "The Great
Divorce Case,"
and I started with
the principle of
making it a farcical
comedy
theatre. Made a
contract with
Henderson for
seven years. This
was in 1&mdash;8&mdash;7&mdash;6.

"The Great Divorce
Case" was
free to anybody
to use, and when
I produced it I
wrote to the
authors in Paris
telling them I
was prepared to
pay them. A week
or two after they
sent their agent
to me, saying that
the same authors
had just produced
a piece in Paris and would like me
to have it. It very much resembled "The
Great Divorce Case," you know; and, on
this basis, I refused it. They sent three
or four times. At last I bought it for a
mere song&mdash;I didn't want it&mdash;&pound;40 down
and &pound;1 a night for a hundred nights!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span> (<i>merrily, for he

Ah! "Davy"! I
produced "Davy"
in '86. I was
about to produce
a farcical comedy,
and, as a matter
of fact, had got
within two days
of the advertised
first night&mdash;indeed,
it came to
within forty-eight
hours of the time&mdash;when
I became
convinced that it
was no use. On
the Friday I
frankly issued an
announcement
stating that I had
no confidence in
the piece. It was
a toss-up between
"Brighton" and
"Wild Oats."
Eventual decision&mdash;"Wild
Oats." A great
success&mdash;Miss
Mary Moore and
David James secured
a big
triumph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Interviewer</span>:
And yourself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: Well, I played
<i>Rover</i>. Up to this moment I had made up
my mind never to play any part of Sotheran's
or Charles Mathews', and when Mr. Calmour
suggested my
playing "David
Garrick," I told
him this. Others
suggested
"Davy," too, and
finally Clement
Scott, one night
at supper, talked
me into it. I was
very nervous of
"D.G." on the
first night,
because I had
altered the intention
of the dramatist
in the
second act by
taking it more
seriously. At one
time I began to
rehearse it with
all the nonsense
out of it, but
finally decided to
curtail the original
"business"
so as not to disappoint
lovers of
the old version.
It ran from November,
1886, to
August, 1887. I
have revived it
every year since,
and so far as paying business goes, "Pink
Dominos" is not in it. Ah! here we are.

me that it's

Oh! I give them
occasionally. I
remember once a couple of seats I gave to a
policeman. When I am studying a part I
like to take long walks in the country&mdash;down
the lanes. On one occasion I was learning
up my character in Gilbert's play of
"Foggerty's Fairy." In the last act I am
supposed to be mad. On the other hand, I
maintain that the keepers appointed over me
are mad and not I. I have to describe a
murder I am supposed to have committed, and
to go through all the details of the crime.
This I did once in a secluded nook in the
Hampstead Woods&mdash;giving it forth at the
top of my voice, thoroughly entering into the
spirit of the business. A policeman caught
sight of me. He had evidently been watching
me for some time. Suddenly he made
for me, seized me by the collar, and said he
should charge me at the station on my own
confession! It took a long time to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>&mdash;but
I succeeded eventually in putting
matters straight with the aid of a sovereign
and a couple of seats for the first night of
"Foggerty"!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: America! Yes,
been there professionally three times.
Wonderfully patient people. One night
I was timed to appear at a certain theatre
at eight o'clock. Breakdown on the line.
Didn't get to playhouse until half-past
nine. Expected to find the theatre empty.
Audience had waited until nine o'clock
without showing a sign of being fidgety.
Manager went before the curtain saying
he had received a telegram from me
explaining the circumstances, and stating
I should shortly arrive. So the sufferers
held on another half-hour, when they began
to file out of the theatre. We met them
all coming out. "Here we are. Here
we are again. Go back! We've arrived!" and
go back they did! Ten minutes afterwards
the curtain had gone up on the first act of

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Mathews</span>: Americans
never grumble. They kept a
train waiting for four hours and a
quarter for us one night, and the
passengers as well! But the passengers
only grumbled in the right
direction. They thought it a bit
too bad, because if they had known
the cause of the long wait, they
might have gone to the theatre!</p>

<p>Then their double E's&mdash;enormous
enterprise. Once we had to wait
for four-and-twenty hours to catch
a train. A manager came to see
me, and pressed for a performance,
at which the prominent citizens of
the town would be present. I consented.
No time to post bills&mdash;they
sent out runners. I went down to
see the hall. Not a seat in the
place! "Don't you worry about
that, you'll find all the chairs there
to-night." And so I did, sure
enough. When I arrived in the
evening the hall was half full of
chairs of all shapes and sizes. Camp
stools, piano stools, three-legged
stools, drawing-room, dining-room,
kitchen chairs&mdash;in fact, anything on
which one might sit down. I couldn't
understand it. I was informed that
it was a rule of the theatre that
everybody who purchased a seat
should provide his own! The
place at night was packed&mdash;the
approaches to the theatre being
crowded with contingents of families
entering the place, followed by Negro
servants carrying half-a-dozen chairs
on their shoulders. I'm wanted on
again. What, are you off?</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;THE CASE OF MR. FOGGATT.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_526.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Almost</span> the only dogmatism
that Martin Hewitt permitted
himself in regard to his professional
methods was one on
the matter of accumulative
probabilities. Often when I
have remarked upon the apparently trivial
nature of the clues by which he allowed
himself to be guided&mdash;sometimes, to all
seeming, in the very face of all likelihood&mdash;he
has replied that two trivialities, pointing
in the same direction, became at once, by
their mere agreement, no trivialities at all, but
enormously important considerations. "If I
were in search of a man," he would say, "of
whom I knew nothing but that he squinted,
bore a birthmark on his right hand, and
limped, and I observed a man who answered
to the first peculiarity,
so far the
clue would be
trivial, because
thousands of men
squint. Now, if
that man presently
moved and exhibited
a birthmark
on his right
hand, the value of
that squint and
that mark would
increase at once
a hundred or a
thousand fold.
Apart they are
little; together
much. The weight
of evidence is not
doubled merely;
it would be only
doubled if half
the men who
squinted had
right-hand birthmarks;
whereas,
the proportion, if
it could be ascertained,
would be
perhaps more like
one in ten thousand.
The two trivialities, pointing in the
same direction, become very strong evidence.
And when the man is seen to walk with a limp,
that limp (another triviality), reinforcing the
others, brings the matter to the rank of
a practical certainty. The Bertillon system
of identification&mdash;what is it but a summary
of trivialities? Thousands of men are
of the same height, thousands of the same
length of foot, thousands of the same
girth of head&mdash;thousands correspond in any
separate measurement you may name. It is
when the measurements are taken <i>together</i>
that you have your man identified for ever.
Just consider how few, if any, of your friends
correspond exactly in any two personal peculiarities."
Hewitt's dogma received its
illustration unexpectedly close at home.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/i_526.jpg" width="282" height="397" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>MR. FOGGATT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The old house wherein my chambers and
Hewitt's office were situated contained, beside
my own, two or three more bachelors' dens,
in addition to the offices on the ground and
first and second
floors. At the very
top of all, at the
back, a fat, middle-aged
man, named
Foggatt, occupied
a set of four
rooms. It was
only after long
residence, by an
accidental remark
of the housekeeper's,
that I
learned the man's
name, which was
not painted on his
door or displayed,
with all the others,
on the wall of the
ground-floor
porch.</p>

<p>Mr. Foggatt appeared
to have
few friends, but
lived in something
as nearly approaching
luxury as an
old bachelor in
chambers can live.
An ascending case
of champagne was
a common phenomenon
of the staircase, and I have more than
once seen a picture, destined for the top floor,
of a sort that went far to awaken green covetousness
in the heart of a poor journalist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span></p>

<p>The man himself was not altogether prepossessing.
Fat as he was, he had a way of
carrying his head forward on his extended
neck and gazing widely about with a pair of
the roundest and most prominent eyes I
remember to have ever seen, except in a
fish. On the whole, his appearance was
rather vulgar, rather arrogant, and rather
suspicious, without any very pronounced
quality of any sort. But certainly he was
not pretty. In the end, however, he was
found shot dead in his sitting-room.</p>

<p>It was in this way: Hewitt and I had
dined together at my club, and late in the
evening had returned to my rooms to smoke
and discuss whatever came uppermost. I
had made a bargain that day with two
speculative odd lots at a book sale, each of
which contained a hidden prize. We sat
talking and turning over these books while
time went unperceived, when suddenly we
were startled by a loud report. Clearly it
was in the building. We listened for a
moment, but heard nothing else, and then
Hewitt expressed his opinion that the
report was that of a gunshot. Gunshots
in residential chambers are not common
things, wherefore I got up and went to
the landing, looking up the stairs and
down.</p>

<p>At the top of the next flight I saw Mrs.
Clayton, the housekeeper. She appeared to
be frightened, and told me that the report
came from Mr. Foggatt's room. She
thought he might have had an accident with
the pistol that usually lay on his mantelpiece.
We went upstairs with her, and she knocked
at Mr. Foggatt's door.</p>

<p>There was no reply. Through the ventilating
fanlight over the door it could be seen
that there were lights within, a sign, Mrs.
Clayton maintained, that Mr. Foggatt was
not out. We knocked again, much more
loudly, and called, but still ineffectually. The
door was locked, and an application of the
housekeeper's key proved that the tenant's key
had been left in the lock inside. Mrs. Clayton's
conviction that "something had happened"
became distressing, and in the end Hewitt
prised open the door with a small poker.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 644px;">
<img src="images/i_527.jpg" width="644" height="435" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Something <i>had</i> happened. In the sitting-room
Mr. Foggatt sat with his head bowed
over the table, quiet and still. The head
was ill to look at, and by it lay a large
revolver, of the full sized Army pattern. Mrs.
Clayton ran back toward the landing with
faint screams.</p>

<p>"Run, Brett," said Hewitt; "a doctor and
a policeman!"</p>

<p>I bounced down the stairs half a flight at
a time. "First," I thought, "a doctor. He
may not be dead." I could think of no
doctor in the immediate neighbourhood,
but ran up the street away from the Strand,
as being the more likely direction for the
doctor, although less so for the policeman.
It took me a good five minutes to find the
medico, after being led astray by a red lamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
at a private hotel, and another five to get
back, with a policeman.</p>

<p>Foggatt was dead, without a doubt. Probably
had shot himself, the doctor thought,
from the powder-blackening and other circumstances.
Certainly nobody could have
left the room by the door, or he must have
passed my landing, while the fact of the door
being found locked from the inside made the
thing impossible. There were two windows to
the room, both of which were shut, one being
fastened by the catch, while the catch of the
other was broken&mdash;an old fracture. Below
these windows was a sheer drop of 50ft. or
more, without a foot or hand-hold near.
The windows in the other rooms were shut
and fastened. Certainly it seemed suicide&mdash;unless
it were one of those accidents that
will occur to people who fiddle ignorantly
with firearms. Soon the rooms were in
possession of the police, and we were turned
out.</p>

<p>We looked in at the housekeeper's kitchen,
where her daughter was reviving and calming
Mrs. Clayton with gin and water.</p>

<p>"You mustn't upset yourself, Mrs.
Clayton," Hewitt said, "or what will become
of us all? The doctor thinks it was an
accident."</p>

<p>He took a small bottle of sewing-machine
oil from his pocket and handed it to the
daughter, thanking her for the loan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was little evidence at the inquest.
The shot had been heard, the body had been
found&mdash;that was the practical sum of the
matter. No friends or relatives of the dead
man came forward. The doctor gave his
opinion as to the probability of suicide or an
accident, and the police evidence tended in
the same direction. Nothing had been found
to indicate that any other person had been
near the dead man's rooms on the night of
the fatality. On the other hand, his papers,
bank-book, etc., proved him to be a man of
considerable substance, with no apparent
motive for suicide. The police had been
unable to trace any relatives, or, indeed, any
nearer connections than casual acquaintances,
fellow club-men, and so on. The jury found
that Mr. Foggatt had died by accident.</p>

<p>"Well, Brett," Hewitt asked me afterwards,
"what do you think of the verdict?"</p>

<p>I said that it seemed to be the most reasonable
one possible, and to square with the
common-sense view of the case.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "perhaps it does.
From the point of view of the jury, and on
their information, their verdict was quite
reasonable. Nevertheless, Mr. Foggatt did
not shoot himself. He was shot by a rather
tall, active young man, perhaps a sailor, but
certainly a gymnast&mdash;a young man whom I
think I could identify, if I saw him."</p>

<p>"But how do you know this?"</p>

<p>"By the simplest possible inferences, which
you may easily guess, if you will but think."</p>

<p>"But, then, why didn't you say this at the
inquest?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, they don't want my
inferences and conjectures at an inquest, they
only want evidence. If I had traced the
murderer, of course then I should have communicated
with the police. As a matter of
fact, it is quite possible that the police have
observed and know as much as I do&mdash;or
more. They don't give everything away at
an inquest, you know&mdash;it wouldn't do."</p>

<p>"But if you are right, how did the man
get away?"</p>

<p>"Come, we are near home now. Let us
take a look at the back of the house. He
<i>couldn't</i> have left by Foggatt's landing door,
as we know; and as he <i>was</i> there (I am
certain of that), and as the chimney is out of
the question&mdash;for there was a good fire in the
grate&mdash;he must have gone out by the window.
Only one window is possible&mdash;that with the
broken catch&mdash;for all the others were
fastened inside. Out of that window, then,
he went."</p>

<p>"But how? The window is 50ft. up."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. But why <i>will</i> you persist
in assuming that the only way of escape
by a window is downward? See, now, look
up there. The window is at the top-floor, and
it has a very broad sill. Over the window is
nothing but the flat face of the gable-end;
but to the right, and a foot or two above the
level of the top of the window, an iron gutter
ends. Observe, it is not of lead composition,
but a strong iron gutter, supported, just
at its end, by an iron bracket. If a tall man
stood on the end of the window-sill, steadying
himself by the left hand and leaning to the
right, he could just touch the end of this
gutter with his right hand&mdash;the full stretch,
toe to finger, is 7ft. 3in.; I have measured it.
An active gymnast, or a sailor, could catch
the gutter with a slight spring, and by it draw
himself upon the roof. You will say he
would have to be <i>very</i> active, dexterous,
and cool. So he would. And that very fact
helps us, because it narrows the field of
inquiry. We know the sort of man to look
for. Because, being certain (as I am) that
the man was in the room, I <i>know</i> that he left
in the way I am telling you. He must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
left in some way, and all the other ways being
impossible, this alone remains, difficult as the
feat may seem. The fact of his shutting the
window behind him further proves his coolness
and address at so great a height from
the ground."</p>

<p>All this was very plain, but the main point
was still dark.</p>

<p>"You say you <i>know</i> that another man was
in the room," I said; "how do you
know that?"</p>

<p>"As I said, by an obvious inference.
Come now, you shall guess
how I arrived at that inference. You
often speak of your interest in my
work, and the attention with which
you follow it. This shall be a simple
exercise for you. You saw everything
in the room as plainly as I myself.
Bring the scene back to your memory,
and think over the various small objects
littering about, and how they would
affect the case. Quick observation is
the first essential for my work. Did
you see a newspaper, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There was an evening paper
on the floor, but I didn't examine it."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"On the table there was a whisky
decanter, taken from the tantalus stand
on the sideboard, and one glass. That,
by-the-bye," I added, "looked as
though only one person were present."</p>

<p>"So it did, perhaps, although the
inference wouldn't be very strong.
Go on."</p>

<p>"There was a fruit-stand on the
sideboard, with a plate beside it, containing
a few nutshells, a piece of apple,
a pair of nutcrackers, and, I think,
some orange peel. There was, of course,
all the ordinary furniture, but no
chair pulled up to the table except that used
by Foggatt himself. That's all I noticed, I
think. Stay&mdash;there was an ash-tray on the
table, and a partly-burned cigar near it&mdash;only
one cigar, though."</p>

<p>"Excellent&mdash;excellent, indeed, as far as
memory and simple observation go. You
saw everything plainly, and you remember
everything. Surely <i>now</i> you know how I
found out that another man had just left?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't; unless there were different
kinds of ash in the ash-tray."</p>

<p>"That is a fairly good suggestion, but
there were not&mdash;there was only a single ash,
corresponding in every way to that on the
cigar. Don't you remember anything that I
did as we went downstairs?"</p>

<p>"You returned a bottle of oil to the housekeeper's
daughter, I think."</p>

<p>"I did. Doesn't that give you a hint?
Come, you surely have it now?"</p>

<p>"I haven't."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 390px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU A HINT?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Then I shan't tell you; you don't deserve
it. Think, and don't mention the subject
again till you have at least one guess to make.
The thing stares you in the face&mdash;you see it,
you remember it, and yet you <i>won't</i> see it.
I won't encourage your slovenliness of
thought, my boy, by telling you what you
can know for yourself if you like. Good-bye&mdash;I'm
off now. There is a case in hand I
can't neglect."</p>

<p>"Don't you propose to go further into
this, then?"</p>

<p>Hewitt shrugged his shoulders. "I'm not
a policeman," he said. "The case is in very
good hands. Of course, if anybody comes
to me to do it as a matter of business, I'll
take it up. It's very interesting, but I can't
neglect my regular work for it. Naturally, I
shall keep my eyes open and my memory in
order. Sometimes these things come into
the hands by themselves, as it were; in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
case, of course, I am a loyal citizen, and
ready to help the law. <i>Au revoir.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am a busy man myself, and thought little
more of Hewitt's conundrum for some time&mdash;indeed,
when I did think, I saw no way to
the answer. A week after the inquest I took
a holiday (I had written my nightly leaders
regularly every day for the past five years),
and saw no more of Hewitt for six weeks.
After my return, with still a few days of leave
to run, one evening we together turned into
Luzatti's, off Coventry Street, for dinner.</p>

<p>"I have been here several times lately,"
Hewitt said; "they feed you very well. No,
not that table"&mdash;he seized my arm as I
turned to an unoccupied corner&mdash;"I fancy
it's draughty." He led the way to a
longer table where a dark, lithe, and (as well
as could be seen) tall young man already sat,
and took chairs opposite him.</p>

<p>We had scarcely seated ourselves before
Hewitt broke into a torrent of conversation
on the subject of bicycling. As our previous
conversation had been of a literary sort, and
as I had never known Hewitt at any other
time to show the slightest interest in bicycling,
this rather surprised me. I had, however,
such a general outsider's grasp of the subject
as is usual in a journalist-of-all-work, and
managed to keep the talk going from my
side. As we went on I could see the face
of the young man opposite brighten with
interest. He was a rather fine-looking fellow,
with a dark though very clear skin, but had
a hard, angry look of eye, a prominence of
cheek-bone, and a squareness of jaw that
gave him a rather uninviting aspect. As
Hewitt rattled on, however, our neighbour's
expression became one of pleasant interest
merely.</p>

<p>"Of course," Hewitt said, "we've a
number of very capital men just now, but
I believe a deal in the forgotten riders
of five, ten, and fifteen years back. Osmond,
I believe, was better than any man riding
now, and I think it would puzzle some of
them to beat Furnivall as he was at his best.
But poor old Cortis&mdash;really, I believe he
was as good as anybody. Nobody ever beat
Cortis&mdash;except&mdash;let me see&mdash;I think somebody
beat Cortis once&mdash;who was it, now?
I can't remember."</p>

<p>"Liles," said the young man opposite,
looking up quickly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;Liles it was; Charley Liles.
Wasn't it a championship?"</p>

<p>"Mile championship, 1880; Cortis won
the other three, though."</p>

<p>"Yes, so he did. I saw Cortis when he
first broke the old 2.46 mile record." And
straightway Hewitt plunged into a whirl of
talk of bicycles, tricycles, records, racing
cyclists, Hillier and Synyer and Noel Whiting,
Taylerson and Appleyard; talk wherein the
young man opposite bore an animated share,
while I was left in the cold.</p>

<p>Our new friend, it seemed, had himself
been a prominent racing bicyclist a few years
back, and was presently, at Hewitt's request,
exhibiting a neat gold medal that hung at his
watch-guard. That was won, he explained,
in the old tall bicycle days, the days of bad
tracks, when every racing cyclist carried
cinder scars on his face from numerous accidents.
He pointed to a blue mark on his
forehead, which, he told us, was a track scar,
and described a bad fall that had cost
him two teeth, and broken others. The gaps
among his teeth were plain to see as he
smiled.</p>

<p>Presently the waiter brought dessert, and
the young man opposite took an apple. Nutcrackers
and a fruit-knife lay on our side of
the stand, and Hewitt turned the stand to
offer him the knife.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," he said, "I only polish a
good apple, never peel it. It's a mistake
except with thick-skinned, foreign ones."</p>

<p>And he began to munch the apple as only
a boy or a healthy athlete can. Presently
he turned his head to order coffee. The
waiter's back was turned, and he had to be
called twice. To my unutterable amazement
Hewitt reached swiftly across the table,
snatched the half-eaten apple from the young
man's plate and pocketed it; gazing immediately,
with an abstracted air, at a painted
Cupid on the ceiling.</p>

<p>Our neighbour turned again, looked doubtfully
at his plate and the tablecloth about it,
and then shot a keen glance in the direction
of Hewitt. He said nothing, however, but
took his coffee and his bill, deliberately
drank the former, gazing quietly at Hewitt
as he did it, paid the latter, and left.</p>

<p>Immediately Hewitt was on his feet and,
taking an umbrella which stood near, followed.
Just as he reached the door he met our late
neighbour, who had turned suddenly back.</p>

<p>"Your umbrella, I think?" Hewitt asked,
offering it.</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks." But the man's eye had
more than its former hardness, and his jaw-muscles
tightened as I looked. He turned
and went. Hewitt came back to me. "Pay
the bill," he said, "and go back to your
rooms; I will come on later: I must follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
this man&mdash;it's the Foggatt case." As he
went out I heard a cab rattle away, and
immediately after it another.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 612px;">
<img src="images/i_531.jpg" width="612" height="392" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HEWITT REACHED SWIFTLY ACROSS THE TABLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I paid the bill and went home. It was
ten o'clock before Hewitt turned up, calling
in at his office below on his way up to me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sidney Mason," he said, "is the
gentleman the police will be wanting to-morrow,
I expect, for the Foggatt murder.
He is as smart a man as I remember ever
meeting, and has done me rather neatly twice
this evening."</p>

<p>"You mean the man we sat opposite at
Luzatti's, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I got his name, of course, from the
reverse of that gold medal he was good
enough to show me. But I fear he has bilked
me over the address. He suspected me, that
was plain, and left his umbrella by way of
experiment, to see if I were watching him
sharply enough to notice the circumstance,
and to avail myself of it to follow him. I
was hasty and fell into the trap. He cabbed
it away from Luzatti's, and I cabbed it after
him. He has led me a pretty dance up and
down London to-night, and two cabbies have
made quite a stroke of business out of us.
In the end he entered a house of which, of
course, I have taken the address, but I
expect he doesn't live there. He is too
smart a man to lead me to his den; but the
police can certainly find something of him at
the house he went in at&mdash;and, I expect, left
by the back way. By the way, you never
guessed that simple little puzzle as to how
I found that this <i>was</i> a murder, did you?
You see it now, of course?"</p>

<p>"Something to do with that apple you
stole, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Something to do with it? I should
think so, you worthy innocent. Just ring
your bell&mdash;we'll borrow Mrs. Clayton's sewing-machine
oil again. On the night we
broke into Foggatt's room you saw the nutshells
and the bitten remains of an apple on
the sideboard, and you remembered it; and
yet you couldn't see that in that piece of
apple possibly lay an important piece of
evidence. Of course, I never expected you
to have arrived at any conclusion, as I had,
because I had ten minutes in which to
examine that apple, and to do what I did
with it. But at least you should have seen
the possibility of evidence in it.</p>

<p>"First, now, the apple was white. A
bitten apple, as you must have observed, turns
of a reddish-brown colour if left to stand long.
Different kinds of apples brown with different
rapidities, and the browning always begins
at the core. This is one of the twenty
thousand tiny things that few people take
the trouble to notice, but which it is useful
for a man in my position to know. A russet
will brown quite quickly. The apple on the
sideboard was, as near as I could tell, a
Newtown pippin or other apple of that kind,
which will brown at the core in from twenty
minutes to half an hour, and in other parts
in a quarter of an hour more. When we saw
it, it was white, with barely a tinge of brown
about the exposed core. Inference&mdash;somebody
had been eating it fifteen or twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
minutes before&mdash;perhaps a little longer; an
inference supported by the fact that it was
only partly eaten.</p>

<p>"I examined that apple, and found it
bore marks of very irregular teeth. While
you were gone I oiled it over, and, rushing
down to my rooms, where I always have a
little plaster of Paris handy for such work,
took a mould of the part where the teeth had
left the clearest marks. I then returned the
apple to its place, for the police to use if
they thought fit. Looking at my mould, it
was plain that the person who had bitten
that apple had lost two teeth, one at top
and one below, not exactly opposite, but
nearly so. The other teeth, although they
would appear to have been fairly sound, were
irregular in size and line. Now the dead
man had, as I saw, a very excellent set of
false teeth, regular and sharp, with none
missing. Therefore it was plain that <i>somebody
else</i> had been eating that apple. Do I
make myself clear?"</p>

<p>"Quite. Go on."</p>

<p>"There were other inferences to be made&mdash;slighter,
but all pointing the same way.
For instance, a man of Foggatt's age does
not as a rule munch an unpeeled apple like
a schoolboy&mdash;inference, a young man, and
healthy. Why I came to the conclusion that
he was tall, active, a gymnast, and perhaps a
sailor, I have already told you, when we
examined the outside of Foggatt's window.
It was also pretty clear that robbery was not
the motive, since nothing was disturbed, and
that a friendly conversation had preceded the
murder&mdash;witness the drinking and the eating
of the apple. Whether or not the police
noticed these things I can't say. If they had
had their best men on they certainly would,
I think; but the case, to a rough observer,
looked so clearly one of accident or suicide,
that possibly they didn't.</p>

<p>"As I said, after the inquest I was unable
to devote any immediate time to the case,
but I resolved to keep my eyes open. The
man to look for was tall, young, strong and
active, with a very irregular set of teeth, a
tooth missing from the lower jaw just to the
left of the centre, and another from the upper
jaw a little further still toward the left. He
might possibly be a person I had seen about
the premises (I have a good memory for faces),
or, of course, he possibly might not.</p>

<p>"Just before you returned from your
holiday I noticed a young man at Luzatti's
whom I remembered to have seen somewhere
about the offices in this building.
He was tall, young, and so on, but I had a
client with me, and was unable to examine
him more narrowly&mdash;indeed, as I was not
exactly engaged on the case, and as there are
several tall young men about, I took little
trouble. But to-day, finding the same young
man with a vacant seat opposite him, I
took the opportunity of making a closer
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"You certainly managed to draw him
out."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;the easiest person in the world
to draw out is a cyclist. The easiest cyclist
to draw out is, of course, the novice, but the
next easiest is the veteran. When you see a
healthy, well-trained looking man, who nevertheless
has a slight stoop in the shoulders,
and, maybe, a medal on his watch-guard, it
is always a safe card to try him first with a
little cycle-racing talk. I soon brought Mr.
Mason out of his shell, read his name on
his medal, and had a chance of observing
his teeth&mdash;indeed, he spoke of them himself.
Now, as I observed just now, there are several
tall, athletic young men about, and also there
are several men who have lost teeth. But
now I saw that this tall and athletic young
man had lost exactly <i>two</i> teeth&mdash;one
from the lower jaw, just to the left of the
centre, and another from the upper jaw,
further still toward the left! Trivialities,
pointing in the same direction, became
important considerations. More, his teeth
were irregular throughout, and, as nearly as
I could remember it, looked remarkably like
this little plaster mould of mine."</p>

<p>He produced from his pocket an irregular
lump of plaster, about three inches long.
On one side of this appeared in relief the
likeness of two irregular rows of six or eight
teeth, minus one in each row, where a deep
gap was seen, in the position spoken of by
my friend. He proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This was enough at least to set me after
this young man. But he gave me the
greatest chance of all when he turned and
left his apple (eaten unpeeled, remember!&mdash;another
important triviality) on his plate.
I'm afraid I wasn't at all polite, and I ran
the risk of arousing his suspicions, but I
couldn't resist the temptation to steal it. I
did, as you saw, and here it is."</p>

<p>He brought the apple from his coat-pocket.
One bitten side, placed against the upper half
of the mould, fitted precisely, a projection of
apple filling exactly the deep gap. The other
side similarly fitted the lower half.</p>

<p>"There's no getting behind that, you see,"
Hewitt remarked. "Merely observing the
man's teeth was a guide, to some extent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
this is as plain as his signature or his thumb-impression.
You'll never find two men <i>bite</i>
exactly alike, no matter whether they leave
distinct teeth-marks or not. Here, by-the-bye,
is Mrs. Clayton's oil. We'll take another
mould from this apple, and compare <i>them</i>."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 624px;">
<img src="images/i_533.jpg" width="624" height="393" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"FITTED PRECISELY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>He oiled the apple, heaped a little plaster
in a newspaper, took my water-jug and
rapidly pulled off a hard mould. The parts
corresponding to the merely broken places in
the apple were, of course, dissimilar; but as
to the teeth-marks, the impressions were
identical.</p>

<p>"That will do, I think," Hewitt said.
"To-morrow morning, Brett, I shall put up
these things in a small parcel, and take them
round to Bow Street."</p>

<p>"But are they sufficient evidence?"</p>

<p>"Quite sufficient for the police purpose.
There is the man, and all the rest&mdash;his
movements on the day and so forth are
simple matters of inquiry; at any rate, that is
police business."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had scarcely sat down to my breakfast on
the following morning when Hewitt came
into the room and put a long letter before
me.</p>

<p>"From our friend of last night," he said;
"read it."</p>

<p>This letter began abruptly, and undated,
and was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Martin Hewitt, Esq.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I must compliment you on the
adroitness you exhibited this evening in
extracting from me my name. The address
I was able to balk you of for the time being,
although by the time you read this you will
probably have
found it through
the <i>Law List</i>, as
I am an admitted
solicitor.
That, however,
will be of little
use to you, for
I am removing
myself, I think,
beyond the reach
even of your
abilities of
search. I knew
you well by sight,
and was, perhaps,
foolish to
allow myself to
be drawn as I
did. Still, I had
no idea that it
would be dangerous, especially after seeing
you, as a witness with very little to say, at the
inquest upon the scoundrel I shot. Your
somewhat discourteous seizure of my apple at
first amazed me&mdash;indeed, I was a little doubtful
as to whether you had really taken it&mdash;but it
was my first warning that you might be
playing a deep game against me, incomprehensible
as the action was to my
mind. I subsequently reflected that I had
been eating an apple, instead of taking
the drink he first offered me, in the dead
wretch's rooms on the night he came to his
merited end. From this I assume that your
design was in some way to compare what
remained of the two apples&mdash;although I do
not presume to fathom the depths of your
detective system. Still, I have heard of many
of your cases, and profoundly admire the keenness
you exhibit. I am thought to be a keen
man myself, but although I was able, to some
extent, to hold my own to-night, I admit
that your acumen in this case alone is something
beyond me.</p>

<p>"I do not know by whom you are commissioned
to hunt me, nor to what extent
you may be acquainted with my connection
with the creature I killed. I have sufficient
respect for you, however, to wish that you
should not regard me as a vicious criminal,
and a couple of hours to spare in which to
offer you an explanation that may persuade
you that such is not altogether the case.
A hasty and violent temper I admit possessing;
but even now I cannot regret the one
crime it has led me into&mdash;for it is, I suppose,
strictly speaking, a crime. For it was the
man Foggatt who made a felon of my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
before the eyes of the world, and killed him
with shame. It was he who murdered my
mother, and none the less murdered her
because she died of a broken heart. That
he was also a thief and a hypocrite might
have concerned me little, but for that.</p>

<p>"Of my father I remember very little. He
must, I fear, have been a weak and incapable
man in many respects. He had no business
abilities&mdash;in fact, was quite unable to understand
the complicated business matters in
which he largely dealt. Foggatt was a consummate
master of all those arts of financial
jugglery that make so many fortunes, and
ruin so many others, in matters of company
promoting, stocks and shares. He was unable
to exercise them, however, because of a great
financial disaster in which he had been mixed
up a few years before, and which made his
name one to be avoided in future. In these
circumstances he made a sort of secret and
informal partnership with my father, who,
ostensibly alone in the business, acted
throughout on the directions of Foggatt,
understanding as little of what he did, poor,
simple man, as a schoolboy would have done.
The transactions carried on went from small
to large, and, unhappily, from honourable to
dishonourable. My father relied on the
superior abilities of Foggatt with an absolute
trust, carrying out each day the
directions given him privately the previous
evening, buying, selling, printing prospectuses,
signing whatever had to be signed, all with
sole responsibility and as sole partner, while
Foggatt, behind the scenes, absorbed the
larger share of the profits. In brief, my
unhappy and foolish father was a mere tool
in the hands of the cunning scoundrel who
pulled all the wires of the business, himself
unseen and irresponsible. At last three
companies, for the promotion of which my
father was responsible, came to grief in a
heap. Fraud was written large over all their
history, and, while Foggatt retired with his
plunder, my father was left to meet ruin,
disgrace, and imprisonment. From beginning
to end he, and he only, was responsible.
There was no shred of evidence to connect
Foggatt with the matter, and no means of
escape from the net drawn about my father.
He lived through three years of imprisonment
and then, entirely abandoned by the
man who had made use of his simplicity, he
died&mdash;of nothing but shame and a broken
heart.</p>

<p>"Of this I knew nothing at the time.
Again and again, as a small boy, I remember
asking of my mother why I had no father
at home, as other boys had&mdash;unconscious
of the stab I thus inflicted on her gentle
heart. Of her my earliest, as well as my
latest, memory is that of a pale, weeping
woman, who grudged to let me out of her
sight.</p>

<p>"Little by little I learnt the whole cause
of my mother's grief, for she had no other
confidant, and I fear my character developed
early, for my first coherent remembrance of
the matter is that of a childish design to
take a table-knife and kill the bad man who
had made my father die in prison and caused
my mother to cry.</p>

<p>"One thing, however, I never knew: the
name of that bad man. Again and again, as I
grew older, I demanded to know, but my
mother always withheld it from me, with a
gentle reminder that vengeance was for a
greater hand than mine.</p>

<p>"I was seventeen years of age when my
mother died. I believe that nothing but her
strong attachment to myself and her desire to
see me safely started in life kept her
alive so long. Then I found that through
all those years of narrowed means she had
contrived to scrape and save a little money&mdash;sufficient,
as it afterwards proved, to see me
through the examinations for entrance to my
profession, with the generous assistance of
my father's old legal advisers, who gave me
my articles, and who have all along treated
me with extreme kindness.</p>

<p>"For most of the succeeding years my
life does not concern the matter in hand. I
was a lawyer's clerk in my benefactors' service,
and afterwards a qualified man among
their assistants. All through, the firm were
careful, in pursuance of my poor mother's
wishes, that I should not learn the name or
whereabouts of the man who had wrecked her
life and my father's. I first met the man himself
at the Clifton Club, where I had gone with
an acquaintance who was a member. It was
not till afterwards that I understood his
curious awkwardness on that occasion. A
week later I called (as I have frequently
done) at the building in which your office is
situated, on business with a solicitor who has
an office on the floor above your own. On
the stairs I almost ran against Mr. Foggatt.
He started and turned pale, exhibiting signs
of alarm that I could not understand, and
asked me if I wished to see him.</p>

<p>"'No,' I replied; 'I didn't know you lived
here. I am after somebody else just now.
Aren't you well?'</p>

<p>"He looked at me rather doubtfully, and
said he was <i>not</i> very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span></p>

<p>"I met him twice or thrice after that, and
on each occasion his manner grew more
friendly, in a servile, flattering, and mean
sort of way&mdash;a thing unpleasant enough in
anybody, but doubly so in the intercourse of
a man with another young enough to be his
own son. Still, of course, I treated the man
civilly enough. On one occasion he asked
me into his rooms to look at a rather fine
picture he had lately bought, and observed
casually, lifting a large revolver from the
mantelpiece:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 451px;">
<img src="images/i_535.jpg" width="451" height="558" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"YOU SEE I AM PREPARED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'You see I am prepared for any unwelcome
visitors to my little den! He! he!'
Conceiving him, of course, to refer to
burglars, I could not help wondering at the
forced and hollow character of his laugh.
As we went down the stairs he said, 'I think
we know one another pretty well now, Mr.
Mason, eh? And if I could do anything to
advance your professional prospects I should
be glad of the chance, of course. I understand
the struggles of a young professional
man&mdash;he! he!' It was the forced laugh
again, and the man spoke nervously. 'I
think,' he added, 'that if you will drop in
to-morrow evening, perhaps I may have a
little proposal to make. Will you?'</p>

<p>"I assented, wondering what this proposal
could be. Perhaps this eccentric old gentleman
was a good fellow, after all, anxious to
do me a good turn, and his awkwardness was
nothing but a natural delicacy in breaking
the ice. I was not so flush of good friends
as to be willing to lose one. He might be
desirous of putting business in my way.</p>

<p>"I went, and was received with a cordiality
that even then seemed a little over-effusive.
We sat and talked of one thing and another
for a long while, and I began to wonder when
Mr. Foggatt was coming to the
point that most interested me.
Several times he invited me to
drink and smoke, but long
usage to athletic training has
given me a distaste for both
practices, and I declined. At
last he began to talk about
myself. He was afraid that my
professional prospects in this
country were not great, but he
had heard that in some of the
Colonies&mdash;South Africa, for
example&mdash;young lawyers had
brilliant opportunities.</p>

<p>"'If you'd like to go there,'
he said, 'I've no doubt, with a
little capital, a clever man like
you could get a grand practice
together very soon. Or you
might buy a share in some good
established practice. I should
be glad to let you have five
hundred pounds, or even a little
more if that wouldn't satisfy
you, and &mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p>"I stood aghast. Why should
this man, almost a stranger,
offer me five hundred pounds,
or even more&mdash;'if that wouldn't
satisfy' me? What claim had
I on him? It was very
generous of him, of course, but
out of the question. I was at least a gentleman,
and had a gentleman's self-respect.
Meanwhile he had gone maundering on, in a
halting sort of way, and presently let slip a
sentence that struck me like a blow between
the eyes.</p>

<p>"'I shouldn't like you to bear ill-will because
of what has happened in the past,' he
said. 'Your late&mdash;your late lamented
mother&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;she had unworthy suspicions&mdash;I'm sure&mdash;it
was best for all
parties&mdash;your father always appreciated &mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 619px;">
<img src="images/i_536.jpg" width="619" height="556" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I STOOD ERECT BEFORE HIM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I set back my chair and stood erect
before him. This grovelling wretch, forcing
the words through his dry lips, was the
thief who had made another of my father
and had brought to miserable ends the lives
of both my parents. Everything was clear.
The creature went in fear of me, never
imagining that I did not know him, and
sought to buy me off; to buy me from the
remembrance of my dead mother's broken
heart for &pound;500&mdash;&pound;500 that he had made
my father steal for him. I said not
a word. But the memory of all my
mother's bitter years, and a savage sense
of this crowning insult to myself, took
a hold upon me, and I was a tiger. Even
then, I verily believe that one word of
repentance, one tone of honest remorse, would
have saved him. But he drooped his eyes,
snuffled excuses, and stammered of 'unworthy
suspicions' and 'no ill-will.' I let him
stammer. Presently he looked up and saw
my face; and fell back in his chair, sick
with terror. I snatched the pistol from the
mantelpiece, and, thrusting it in his face,
shot him where he sat.</p>

<p>"My subsequent coolness and quietness
surprise me now. I took my hat and stepped
toward the door. But there were voices on
the stairs. The door was locked on the
inside, and I left it so. I went back and
quietly opened a window. Below was a clear
drop into darkness, and above was plain
wall; but away to
one side, where the
slope of the gable
sprang from the
roof, an iron gutter
ended, supported
by a strong bracket.
It was the only way.
I got upon the sill
and carefully shut
the window behind
me, for people were
already knocking at
the lobby door.
From the end of
the sill, holding on
by the reveal of the
window with one
hand, leaning and
stretching my utmost,
I caught the
gutter, swung myself
clear, and
scrambled on the
roof. I climbed
over many roofs
before I found, in
an adjoining street,
a ladder lashed
perpendicularly
against the front of
a house in course of repair. This, to me,
was an easy opportunity of descent, notwithstanding
the boards fastened over the face
of the ladder, and I availed myself of it.</p>

<p>"I have taken some time and trouble in
order that you (so far as I am aware the
only human being beside myself who knows
me to be the author of Foggatt's death)
shall have at least the means of appraising
my crime at its just value of culpability.
How much you already know of what I
have told you I cannot guess. I am
wrong, hardened and flagitious, I make no
doubt, but I speak of the facts as they are.
You see the thing, of course, from your own
point of view&mdash;I from mine. And I remember
my mother.</p>

<p>"Trusting that you will forgive the odd
freak of a man&mdash;a criminal, let us say&mdash;who
makes a confidant of the man set to hunt
him down, I beg leave to be, Sir, your
obedient servant,</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Sidney Mason</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>I read the singular document through and
handed it back to Hewitt.</p>

<p>"How does it strike you?" Hewitt asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mason would seem to be a man of very
marked character," I said. "Certainly no
fool. And, if his tale is true, Foggatt is no
great loss to the world."</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;if the tale is true. Personally,
I am disposed to believe it is."</p>

<p>"Where was the letter posted?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't posted. It was handed in with
the others from the front door letter-box this
morning in an unstamped envelope. He
must have dropped it in himself during the
night. Paper," Hewitt proceeded, holding it
up to the light, "Turkey mill, ruled foolscap.
Envelope, blue official shape, Pirie's watermark.
Both quite ordinary and no special
marks."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 537px;">
<img src="images/i_537.jpg" width="537" height="544" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"TURKEY MILL, RULED FOOLSCAP."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Where do you suppose he's gone?"</p>

<p>"Impossible to guess. Some might think
he meant suicide by the expression 'beyond
the reach even of your abilities of search,' but
I scarcely think he is the sort of man to do
that. No, there is no telling. Something may
be got by inquiring at his late address, of
course; but when such a man tells you he
doesn't think you will find him, you may
count upon its being a difficult job. His
opinion is not to be despised."</p>

<p>"What shall you do?"</p>

<p>"Put the letter in the box with the casts
for the police. <i>Fiat justitia</i>, you know,
without any question of sentiment. As to
the apple&mdash;I really think, if the police will
let me, I'll make you a present of it. Keep
it somewhere as a souvenir of your absolute
deficiency in reflective observation in this
case, and look at it whenever you feel yourself
growing dangerously conceited. It should
cure you."</p>

<p>This is the history of the withered and
almost petrified half-apple that stands in my
cabinet among a number of flint implements
and one or two rather fine old
Roman vessels. Of Mr. Sidney Mason we
never heard another word. The police did
their best, but he had left not a track
behind him. His rooms were left almost
undisturbed, and he had gone without anything
in the way of elaborate preparation
for his journey, and yet without leaving a
trace of his intentions.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>L&Ouml;IE FULLER'S BIRTHPLACE.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>La Reine L&ouml;ie does not
claim for <i>herself</i> the distinction
of being the inventor of
the graceful evolutions which
have made her name famous
all over Europe and America.
She says: "I have only revived a forgotten
art, for I have been able to trace some of my
dances back to four thousand years ago: to
the time when Miriam and the women of
Israel&mdash;filled with religious fervour and rapture&mdash;celebrated
their release from Egyptian
captivity with 'timbrels and with dances.'"</p>

<p>This is true; but as "there is <i>nothing</i>
new under the sun," I contend that
Miss Fuller deserves her title, and also
all the tribute and admiration which those
who have seen her dance long to lay at her
feet. For not even the most realistic
description, or the most earnest study of the
illustrations which still exist of the girl-dancers
of Herculaneum and Pompeii, who, in mist-like
robes, with un-girdled waists and
sandalled feet, with languorous movements
and rapturous uplifted faces, entranced even
the most besotted among the revellers
at the notorious bacchanalian orgies of
those cities of the past&mdash;not these,
not even the most brilliant pen-painting
can convey any idea of La L&ouml;ie's
exquisite dancing. With continuous but
gentle movements of arms, feet, and
shapely form, the outline of which is
sometimes veiled, and at other times
revealed amid the folds of her gauzy
garments of ever-changing rainbow-like tints,
she appears like a supernatural being sent
to teach us the poetry of motion.</p>

<p>Suddenly the scene changes; the dancer,
with joyous face, parted lips, and floating
tresses of red gold, to the accompaniment
of weird music, flits here and there: now
dreamily floating along the stage, then rapidly
whirling round and round; one moment
appearing a blaze of fire, the next with
sombre draperies, every fold seeming incrusted
with jewels, the little feet hardly touching
the ground, the pliant form bending and
swaying in the constantly-changing light, like
some gay-plumaged tropical bird, until her
audience hold their breath with admiration.</p>

<p>What a treasure she would have been to
the Egyptian and Roman priests of old, in
their temple mysteries and religious festivals.
And what trouble she would have caused in
the last century; indeed, in all probability
she would have been burned as a witch; for
our ancestors did not waste time in wondering
at or admiring things they did not understand,
but resorted to fire or water to solve
their difficulties.</p>

<p>La L&ouml;ie's early history is as remarkable as
her dances: she has been a reciter, actress,
singer, and play-writer, and finally, by a mere
accidental circumstance, success has been
thrust upon her as a dancer. With that delicate
sister-feeling which makes us&mdash;providing
there is no rivalry&mdash;so wondrous kind, I was
not curious about Miss Fuller's <i>present</i> age;
for, after all, paltry years count not with us,
providing the heart keeps young; but I felt
I could with discretion inquire at what age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
she made her first appearance, and learnt to
my great surprise that she made her d&eacute;but,
at the early age of two, at a Sunday-school
entertainment at Chicago; where, unheralded
and unannounced, she toddled on to
the platform and recited "Mary had
a little lamb," in a sweet, shrill treble
which was distinctly audible throughout the
hall. The wee, quaint little maiden who so
gravely contributed her share to the evening's
amusement succeeded in charming the
audience, and her services were often in
request after this.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>L&Ouml;IE FULLER'S FATHER.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by Mora, Broadway, New York.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Two years later she was engaged to play
the little boy's part with Mrs. Chanfrau in
"Was She Right?" and astonished everyone
with her self-possession and ability; but she
unfortunately had to give up her part before
many months were over, as her parents
removed to Monmouth, Illinois. Little L&ouml;ie
then set up as a temperance lecturer,
and her first attempt brought her in
a profit of twenty dollars. Her little lectures
were, of course, taken out of books and
newspapers, and committed to memory, but
delivered with such excellent elocutionary
effect and earnestness, that she was soon in
great demand all over the State, and known
as the "Western Temperance Prodigy."
Only eleven years of age! yet earning her
own living, and doing good work&mdash;at least,
doing what she was able and that which was
nearest her hand!</p>

<p>She longed for a chance to return to the
stage, and before long got her opportunity,
for her parents returned to Chicago to live,
and she found no difficulty in again obtaining
engagements. She worked unceasingly, was
gifted with an excellent memory, was always
ready and willing to play any r&ocirc;le, big or
little, that was allotted to her, devoting herself
with ardour to the study of every detail of
her work; thus, before she had reached the
age of sixteen, she had won for herself a
reputation that many an experienced actress
of twice that age would have been proud of.</p>

</div>

<p>A pianist in Chicago, having heard Miss
Fuller sing, was so enraptured with her
beautiful voice, that he offered to give her
free tuition for two years. The offer was
accepted, and at the end of that period she
had made such good progress that she was
engaged by Mr. J. M. Hill to go on tour, and
later on made her appearance in New York
as <i>Jack Sheppard</i>, with a salary of seventy-five
dollars a week. Her path was not always
strewn with roses. She climbed her way
steadily up the ladder of fame through many
difficulties and discouragements, never ceased
working, hardly ever had a penny to spare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
but was always the same bright,
cheery little woman that she now
is at the zenith of her success, and
loved as well as admired by all who
know her.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MISS L&Ouml;IE FULLER.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by Sarony, New York.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>L&ouml;ie Fuller made a great hit as
<i>Ustane</i> in "She," at Niblo's Theatre,
and was also in the cast of
"Caprice," in London. After which
she returned to America to take
part in "Quack, M.D.," which was
being produced at the Harlem
Opera House, and it was while
rehearsing her part for this play
that the tide rose which was to bear
her to fame and fortune. It came
in the shape of a box sent by a
young Indian officer whom Miss
Fuller had only met once when
she was in London. With eager
fingers she removed the many
wrappers, and found the contents
consisted of a beautiful Eastern
gown of soft white silk; the sort
of material that would pass uncreased
through a ring, and for
texture and exquisite whiteness
might have formed a fitting garment
for Titania herself.</p>

<p>Great was her delight at this unexpected
gift, and she wore it in the
hypnotic scene in "Quack, M.D."
The dainty robe adapted itself
admirably to her supple form, which
had never been incased in a corset;
and after the play was over, she tried
the effects of it, by dancing a few
steps in front of her cheval glass.
The long, sweeping folds lent themselves
to every movement. Hours
passed, yet still she flung the snowy
fabric round her, and pirouetted
about, registering in her mind for
future reference, the effect of each
position and step.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE WIDOW DANCE.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>That night was born the Serpentine
Dance. Much practising added
grace to the figure and flexibility
to the limbs, and the dance, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
in its initial stage, took everyone
by storm, and La L&ouml;ie's name
became famous throughout America.
Hungering for "other worlds to
conquer," she came to Europe, the
first place she visited being Germany,
where she was very well
received. Her next move was to
Paris, where she gave a private
rehearsal before the manager of
the Folies Berg&egrave;re, who instantly
engaged her.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GOOD NIGHT.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by Reutlinger, Paris.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>All Paris went mad over her
dancing, and the management of
the Folies Berg&egrave;re, anxious to
secure their prize, concluded a
three years' engagement with her,
at the largest salary ever paid to
a dancer, or indeed to an actress,
namely, &pound;200 a week, and a suite
of rooms in the theatre. This
seems enormous, but unfortunately
for the present it does not go
into Miss Fuller's pocket&mdash;for the
year previous to her Parisian
engagement she had signed a contract
to go to Russia, but when on
her way there, she received a telegram
stating that her mother was
dangerously ill, and, without an
instant's delay, she returned and
cancelled her engagement. Her heavy
luggage having preceded her to
Russia, it was seized, her dresses
confiscated, and an action brought
against her, which she had the misfortune
to lose, and was compelled
to pay a heavy indemnity.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE RAINBOW.</p>

<p><i>From a Photo by Sarony, New York.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The dancing of La L&ouml;ie has so
raised the reputation of the Folies
Berg&egrave;re that now the most particular
Parisian has no hesitation about
taking his wife or lady friends there,
and although it was her 300th appearance
on January 6th, her popularity
is as great if not greater than
it has ever been.</p>

<p>"La Belle Americaine" has been
invited to dance at the smartest
houses in Paris, though for this
privilege the Folies Berg&egrave;re charged
&pound;40 for every performance, while
the preparatory expenses and light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
cost an additional &pound;100. The wife
of the American Minister invited her
to give a private performance at her
residence in Paris: the necessary
stage and other arrangements took
forty men two days and two nights
to complete. La L&ouml;ie on that occasion
surpassed herself, and caused a
perfect <i>furore</i> among the guests.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE FLOWER DANCE.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The one dance has become many,
among which the principal favourites
are the "Widow Dance"&mdash;in black
robe and with powdered hair and
patches; the "Rainbow," "Mirror,"
"Flower," "Butterfly," and "Good
Night" dances, and the dresses for
each she has designed herself; their
shape is kept a secret. One of the
most beautiful of her gowns&mdash;if I
may so designate these mysteriously
lovely draperies&mdash;was painted on thin
silk in sections, and then the artists
engaged on it had no idea what their
work was intended for. Her first
dress&mdash;the present sent her by the
young Indian&mdash;is, although much the
worse for wear, her favourite. As the artiste
comes off the stage she is completely enveloped
in a huge cloak by her mother, who
is always with her, and I have never met anyone
who has the slightest idea of
what her dress is like off the stage;
though, whatever it may be, its
effect is bewilderingly beautiful.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE BUTTERFLY DANCE.</p>

<p><i>From a Photograph.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The dancer in private is simply
a bonnie, blue-eyed little woman,
plain in her dress, and with a sweet
frankness of manner and speech
which render her eminently attractive.
Her rooms boast of no
costly luxuries, bric-&agrave;-brac, or the
thousand and one costly trifles
which artistes usually surround
themselves with. One thing attracts
you as you enter the little sitting-room,
and that is a bust of her, by
the great sculptor Hussin; in her
boudoir are also several miniature
models of stages, and it is by all
sorts of experiments on these that
Miss Fuller is enabled to judge of
the effect of any new dance and
lighting. At the conclusion of
your visit you could not help feeling that
you had been privileged to meet not only
a great artiste, but also a good woman,
against whose reputation a censorious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
jealous world has
never dared to
breathe a word.</p>

<p>Needless to say,
a host of imitators
has arisen, some
of whom, not content
with pirating
her dances, have
tried to copy her
dresses and even
to use her name.
The complicated
lighting apparatus
which attracts so
much admiration
is managed by the
dancer's brothers,
who practise every
day with her, and
as she is always
inventing new dances, their work is no
sinecure.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE MIRROR DANCE.</p>

<p><i>From a Drawing.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>One of her greatest successes has been the
"Mirror Dance," in which, by some mysterious
arrangement, eight L&ouml;ie Fullers appear to be
dancing at the same time, and the whole stage
is bathed in a flood of glorious tints, in which
may be seen aerial forms, in cloudlike
vestures, whirling and dancing as if they were
the fabled victims of the Tarantula; the
whole forming an artistic spectacular effect
that the world has
never seen equalled.</p>

<p>There is only one
sad note in the whole
history of the clever
little dancer&mdash;that is,
her delicate health,
and more especially
the paralysis of the
arms with which she
once or twice has
been threatened. She
works very hard, and
has to train as severely
as any jockey. Short
as her performances
are, they are very
fatiguing and a great
physical strain.</p>

</div>

<p>A great compliment
is now being paid her,
the result of which
the next Salon will
show, for a clever
young American artist
has selected "L&ouml;ie's
Dance" as his subject.
It is a large picture and vigorously treated:
only half the dancer is shown, and she appears
as if dancing <i>out</i> of the canvas. Miss Fuller
has done wonders in improving the public
taste, and proving that dancing is not an art
that degrades, but, with modestly-draped
figure and graceful movements, an educator, as
everything that is beautiful ought to be. Let us
hope that the craze for high kicking, unnatural
straining of the muscles, and the hideous
short skirts and scanty bodice will become a
thing of the past, and
that a mere display of
skill and agility without
the elegance or
grace which ought to
characterize the Terpsichorean
art will die
a natural death. La
Belle L&ouml;ie will visit
England about May,
and it is to be hoped
that she will be accorded
such a welcome
as will induce
her to prolong her
stay among us. For
it may truly be said
there is not a discordant
note in her
whole performance,
or a gesture or movement
which would
wound the susceptibilities
of the most
modest-minded of
British matrons or
maidens.</p>

GOLD HAIRS <span class="smcap">OF</span>
OLD VSEVEDE</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A Story for Children
From the SERVIAN</span></p></div>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_546.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is related that there was once
a King who was passionately
fond of hunting the wild beasts
of his forests. On one occasion
he chased a stag so far and so
long that he lost his way.
Finding himself quite alone and night coming
on, he was glad to fall in with the hut of a
charcoal-burner.</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to conduct me to
the nearest highway? I will generously
reward you for the service."</p>

<p>"I would do it with pleasure," replied the
charcoal-burner, "but I have a wife who is
about to become a mother, and I cannot
leave her alone. On the other hand, why
cannot you pass the night with me? Go up
into our hay-loft, and rest yourself upon a
truss of sweet-smelling hay which you will
find there, and to-morrow I will guide you
on your way."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the charcoal-burner's
wife brought into the world an infant son.</p>

<p>The King was unable to sleep. At midnight
he noticed lights moving in the chamber
beneath, and, applying his eye to a crack in
the floor, he perceived the charcoal-burner
sleeping; his wife lying in a half-fainting condition;
and, lastly, standing
by the new-born child, three
old women, dressed in white
and holding each a lighted
wax candle, who were conversing.</p>

<p>The first said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To this boy I give courage
to dare all dangers."</p>

<p>The second said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will endow him with the faculty
of being able to escape all dangers
and to be long-lived."</p>

<p>The third said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As for me, I will give him the
hand of the daughter just born to
the King who is sleeping in the hay-loft
over our heads."</p>

<p>With the utterance of the last words, the
lights went out and all was silent again.</p>

<p>The King was as much stunned with
sorrow and surprise as if he had received a
sword's point in his breast. Until dawn,
without closing an eye, he lay thinking of how
he might prevent the realization of the
witch's prediction.</p>

<p>With the first beams of morning light, the
infant began to cry. The charcoal-burner
rose and, going to his wife's side, found that
she was dead.</p>

<p>"Poor little orphan!" he cried, sadly;
"what will become of you, bereft of a mother's
care?"</p>

<p>"Confide this child to me," said the King;
"I will take care of it, and it will find itself
well off. As to yourself, I will give you so
much money that you shall have no further
need to tire yourself by burning charcoal."</p>

<p>The charcoal-burner gave his consent with
pleasure, and the King departed, promising
to send somebody for the infant. The Queen
and the courtiers had, meanwhile, arranged
to give the King an agreeable surprise, by
announcing to him the birth of a charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
little Princess, who had come into the world
on the night when the King, her father, saw
the three witches. Knitting his brow, the
King called one of his attendants to him and
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 562px;">
<img src="images/i_547.jpg" width="562" height="562" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HOLDING EACH A LIGHTED WAX CANDLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Go to such and such a place in the
forest, to the hut of a charcoal-burner, to
whom you will give this money in exchange
for a new-born child. Take the brat and,
somewhere on your way, drown it. Only
remember that if it be not thoroughly done
away with, you yourself shall take its place."</p>

<p>The servant received the infant in a basket,
and, having reached a footbridge over a wide
and deep river, he threw the basket and the
infant into the stream.</p>

<p>"A good journey to you, son-in-law!"
cried the King, on hearing the servant's
report of his mission.</p>

<p>The King believed that the child was
drowned, but it was neither drowned nor
dead; on the contrary, supported by the
basket in which it was inclosed, the little one
floated gently down the river, as in a cradle,
and slept as sweetly as if its mother had sung
it to rest.</p>

<p>After awhile the basket came near the hut
of a fisherman who,
while busy repairing his
nets, caught sight of
something floating in
the water in mid-stream.
Quickly jumping into
his boat, he rowed out
to the object and, having
secured it, ran to tell his
wife what he had found.</p>

<p>"You have always desired
to have a son," he cried;
"here is a handsome one
brought to us by the river."</p>

<p>The fisherman's
wife received the
infant with great
joy, and tended it
as if it were her
own. They called
it Plavacete (the
Swimmer), because
it came to them
floating on the
waters. Years sped, the little foundling
grew up to be a man, and in none of
the neighbouring villages was there a
youth to compare with him.</p>

<p>Now, it happened one day, in the
summer time, that the King rode out
unattended. The heat was excessive,
and he reined in his steed in front of
the fisherman's hut to ask for a glass of cold
water. Plavacete brought it out to him;
the King looked at him intently, then,
turning to the fisherman, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have a handsome youth there: is he
your son?"</p>

<p>"Yes and no," replied the fisherman.
"Twenty years ago, I found a tiny child in a
basket floating down the river; I and my
wife adopted him."</p>

<p>The King turned pale as death, for he
guessed that it was the same infant that he
had condemned to be drowned. Collecting
himself, he dismounted and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want to send a message to the castle,
and I have nobody with me; can this youth
deliver it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the fisherman; "your
Majesty may rely on his intelligence."</p>

<p>Thereupon the King sat down and wrote
to the Queen these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The young man who brings you this
message is the most dangerous of all my
enemies. As soon as he arrives, have his
head chopped off. Do not delay one
moment and have no pity; let him be
executed before I return to the castle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span></p>

<p>After carefully folding the letter, he
fastened it with the Royal seal.</p>

<p>Plavacete took the letter and set off with it
through the forest, which was so wide and
dense that he lost his way in it. Overtaken
by night in the midst of his adventurous
journey, he met an old woman.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Plavacete, where
are you going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am intrusted with a letter for
the Royal castle, but I have lost
my way; can you not, good mother,
set me on my right road?"</p>

<p>"To-day, my child, that is
impossible. Darkness has come,
and you would not have
time to reach the Royal
castle," replied the old
woman. "Rest in my
dwelling-place to-night&mdash;you
will not be with a
stranger there, for I am
your god-mother."</p>

<p>The young man obeyed,
and they entered a charming
cottage which seemed
suddenly to rise out of the
ground. Now,
while Plavacete
was sleeping, the
old woman
changed his letter
for another, running
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Immediately
upon receiving
this letter, conduct
the bearer
to the Princess,
our daughter.
This young man
is our son-in-law,
and I wish them to be married
before my return to the castle.
Such is my will."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i_548.jpg" width="355" height="589" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE THREW THE BASKET AND THE
INFANT INTO THE STREAM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>After reading the letter, the
Queen gave orders for the preparation
of all that was needed
for the celebration of the
wedding. Both she and her
daughter were greatly pleased with the
behaviour of the young man, and nothing
troubled the happiness of the newly-married
pair.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the King returned
to his castle and, having previously learned
what had taken place, began to scold the
Queen.</p>

<p>"But you expressly ordered me to have
them married before your return: here is
your letter&mdash;read it again," replied the Queen.</p>

<p>He carefully examined the epistle, and was
obliged to admit that the paper, the writing,
and the seal were all unquestionably authentic.
He thereupon called for his son-in-law,
and interrogated him as to the details of
his journey.</p>

<p>Plavacete withheld nothing from his father-in-law,
and related
how he had
lost his way in
the forest and
had passed the
night there in a
cottage.</p>

<p>"What is this
old woman like?"
asked the King.</p>

<p>On hearing the
description given
him by Plavacete,
the King was convinced
that it was
the identical old
woman who,
twenty years previously,
had predicted
the marriage
of the
Princess with the
charcoal-burner's
son.</p>

<p>After reflecting
for awhile, the
King went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is done
is done: only
you cannot be
my son-in-law on
such slight
grounds. For a
wedding present, you must
bring me three hairs plucked
from the head of Dede-Vsevede,
the old man who knows all and
sees all."</p>

<p>He thought by this means to
get rid of his son-in-law, whose
presence embarrassed him.</p>

<p>Plavecete took leave of his wife
departed, saying to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not know which way to turn my
steps; but no matter, my god-mother will
direct them."</p>

<p>He was not deceived. Without difficulty
he found the right road, and pressed forward
for a long time over hill and dale and river,
until he reached the shore of the Black Sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
and observed a boat with its one boatman,
to whom he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, old boatman!"</p>

<p>"The same to you, young traveller.
Where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"To the castle of Dede-Vsevede, to get
three hairs from his head."</p>

<p>"If that is so, welcome! I have long
awaited the arrival of such an envoy as you.
For twenty years I have been rowing
passengers across, and not one of them
has done anything to deliver me. If you
promise me to ask Dede-Vsevede when
I am to have a substitute to free me from
my troubles, I will row you over in my
boat."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i_549.jpg" width="520" height="607" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"PLAVACETE TOOK
THE LETTER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Plavacete promised, and the boatman
rowed him to the opposite shore. He thence
continued his journey, and approached a
great city, which was partially in ruins. Not
far from it he saw a funeral procession; the
King of the country followed the coffin of his
father, and tears as big as peas rolled down
his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Heaven console you
in your distress," said
Plavacete.</p>

<p>"Thanks, good traveller.
Whither are you going?"</p>

<p>"To the castle of Dede-Vsevede,
in search of three
hairs from his head."</p>

<p>"You are really going
to the castle of Dede-Vsevede?
What a pity
you did not come some
weeks ago! We
have long been
waiting such an
envoy as you."</p>

<p>Plavacete was
introduced to
the Court of the
King, who said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have learned that
you are bound on a mission
to the castle of Dede-Vsevede:
alas! we had
here an apple-tree which
produced youth-giving
fruit; one only of its
apples, as soon as it was
eaten, even by a person at
the point of death, instantly
cured and rejuvenated
him. But for
the last twenty years this tree has not borne
either flower or fruit. Will you promise me
to ask the cause of Dede-Vsevede?"</p>

<p>"I promise you."</p>

<p>After that, Plavacete came to a large,
beautiful, but silent city. Near the gate he
met an old man, who, staff in hand, was
hobbling along with great difficulty.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, good old man!"</p>

<p>"Heaven bless <i>you</i>! Whither are you
going, handsome traveller?"</p>

<p>"To the castle of Dede-Vsevede, in search
of three hairs from his head."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are the very envoy I have so
long been expecting. I must conduct you to
my master, the King. Follow me."</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived, the King said to
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hear that you have come on an embassy
to Dede-Vsevede. We had here a well which
used to fill itself, and which was so marvellous
in its effects that sick people were
immediately cured on drinking of its water.
A few drops sprinkled upon a corpse sufficed
to resuscitate it. Well, for twenty years
past, this well has been dried up. If
you promise to ask Dede-Vsevede how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
we can re-fill our well, I will reward you
royally."</p>

<p>Plavacete promised, and the King dismissed
him graciously.</p>

<p>Continuing his journey, he had to pass
through a wide forest, in the midst of which
he perceived a broad, grassy plain, full of
beautiful flowers, in the centre of which
stood a castle built of gold.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/i_550.jpg" width="463" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE PALACE OF DEDE-VSEVEDE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was the palace of Dede-Vsevede, radiant
with splendour, looking as if it were made of
fire. Plavacete entered it without encountering
a single moving creature, except an old
woman, half-hidden in a corner spinning.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Plavacete! I am glad to see
you here."</p>

<p>It was, once more, his god-mother, the
same who had offered him shelter in her
forest cottage when he was carrying the King's
treacherous message.</p>

<p>"Tell me what brings you here, from so
far off?"</p>

<p>"The King will not have me for his son-in-law
without being paid for it; so he has
sent me here to fetch for him three gold hairs
from the head of Dede-Vsevede."</p>

<p>His god-mother burst into laughter, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Dede-Vsevede? Why, I am his
mother&mdash;he is the shining Sun in person!
Every morning he is a child; at noon he
becomes a man; at evening he withers to
the likeness of a decrepit, hundred-year-old
man. But I will contrive
to get you three gold hairs
from his head, so that
you may know that I am
not your god-mother for
nothing. For all that,
however, you cannot remain
here any longer as
you are. My son, the Sun,
is endowed with a charitable
soul; but, on returning
home, he is always
hungry, and it would not
astonish me if, as soon as
he comes back, he ordered
you to be roasted for his
supper. To hide you I
will overturn this empty
box, under which you must
creep."</p>

<p>Before obeying, Plavacete
begged his god-mother
to obtain from Dede-Vsevede
answers to the
three questions which he
had promised to get from
him.</p>

<p>"I will put the questions
to him, but you must carefully
listen to the answers
he returns."</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind was
unchained without, and,
through a window on the
western side of the castle,
arrived the Sun&mdash;an old
man with a head of gold.</p>

<p>The old man sat down to supper. After
the meal was finished, he placed his head
of gold upon his mother's knees and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw that he was sleeping
soundly, she plucked from his head one of
his gold hairs and threw it upon the floor:
in falling the hair made a metallic sound, like
the string of a guitar when struck.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me, mother?"
asked the old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing, my son; I was sleeping and
dreaming a strange dream."</p>

<p>"What was it about, mother?"</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a place&mdash;I don't know
where&mdash;where there was a well supplied with
water from a spring, by which sick people
were cured, and even dying persons, after
drinking a single mouthful of it; and more
than that, corpses even were resuscitated
after having been sprinkled with a few drops
of this marvellous
water. But for
twenty years this
well has remained
dry: what should
be done to fill it
as of old?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/i_551.jpg" width="373" height="592" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>HE PLACED HIS HEAD OF GOLD UPON HIS MOTHER'S KNEES."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The remedy
is simple enough:
a frog has lodged
itself in the opening,
and so prevents
the water of
the spring entering
the well. Let
them kill the frog,
and their well will
be as full of water
as it used to be."</p>

<p>When the old
man was again
soundly sleeping,
the old woman
plucked another
gold hair from his
head and threw it
upon the floor.</p>

<p>"What do you
want of me,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my
son, nothing.
While sleeping I
had a strange
vision. It seemed
to me that the
inhabitants of a
city&mdash;what city I
do not know&mdash;had
in their garden an apple-tree, the
apples of which possessed the virtue of
renewing the youth of whomsoever ate
of them. A single apple eaten by an
old man sufficed to give back to him the
strength and freshness of youth. Now, for
twenty years, that tree has borne neither
flower nor fruit. By what means can they
bring back to it its former power?"</p>

<p>"The means are not difficult. A viper
has hidden itself amongst the roots of their
tree and feeds on its sap; let them kill the
viper and transplant the tree, and they will
soon see it covered with fruit as it used to be."</p>

<p>Thereupon the old man once more went
off to sleep soundly. The old woman plucked
from his head the third gold hair.</p>

<p>"Why do you not let me sleep in peace,
mother?" cried the old man, angrily, and
trying to rise.</p>

<p>"Lie still, my
beloved son, and
do not disturb
yourself. I am
sorry for having
waked you. I
was having a
strange dream.
Fancy! I seemed
to see a boatman,
on the shore of
the Black Sea,
complaining to a
traveller that, for
twenty years, nobody
had come
to replace him:
when will that
poor old man be
relieved of his
task?"</p>

<p>"He is an imbecile,
that is all!
He has only to
put his oar into
the hand of the
first person who
wants to be rowed
and jump ashore.
Whoever receives
the oar will replace
him as boatman.
But leave
me in peace,
mother, and do
not wake me any
more; for I have
to be up early,
first to dry the
tears of the Princess, the wife of a charcoal-burner's
son. The young creature passes
her nights in weeping for her husband,
who has been sent by the King, her father,
to fetch him three gold hairs from my head."</p>

<p>Next morning the winds were heard howling
around the palace of Dede-Vsevede, and
instead of an old man, a beautiful child,
with hair of gold, awoke on the old woman's
knees: it was the divine Sun, who, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
taking leave of his mother, flew out of the
eastern window of his palace.</p>

<p>The old woman hastened to turn over the
box, and said to Plavacete:&mdash;</p>

<p>"See! here are the three gold hairs, and
you already know the three answers given by
Dede-Vsevede. Now hasten away, and
Heaven be with you on your way. You will
never see me again, for you will never again
have need of me."</p>

<p>Plavacete gratefully thanked her and
departed.</p>

<p>On reaching the city of the dried-up well,
and questioned by the King as to what good
news he was the bearer of, he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have your well carefully cleared out;
then kill the frog which obstructs the incoming
of the marvellous water from the
spring, and you will see it flow as freely as
ever."</p>

<p>The King followed the direction of Plavacete,
and, delighted to see his well once
more filled, made him a present of twelve
horses as white as swans, to which he
added as much gold and silver as they
could carry.</p>

<p>On arriving at the second city and questioned
by the King as to the news he brought,
he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The news I bring you is excellent; none
could be better, in fact. You have but to
dig up your apple-tree and transplant it, after
killing the reptile which has been living
amongst its roots; that done, your tree will
produce you apples as it formerly did."</p>

<p>Indeed, no sooner was the tree transplanted
than it became covered with flowers,
as if a shower of roses had fallen upon it.
The King, filled with joy, made him a present
of twelve horses as black as ravens, and
loaded them with as much riches as they
could bear.</p>

<p>Continuing his journey to the shore of the
Black Sea, he found the boatman, who
inquired whether he had learnt for him
when the time of his deliverance would come.
Plavacete first made him convey him and his
horses on to the opposite shore: that done,
he advised the boatman to hand his oar to
the first traveller who required his services, so
that he might be definitely released from his
duty.</p>

<p>The King, Plavacete's father-in-law, could
not at first believe his eyes on seeing him
the possessor of the three gold hairs plucked
from the head of Dede-Vsevede. As to the
young wife, she shed hot tears, not of sadness,
but of joy, at seeing her beloved back
again in safety, and she said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How were you able, dear husband, to
acquire so many magnificent horses laden
with riches?"</p>

<p>He replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All has been purchased with heaviness of
heart, with the ready money of pains and
labours, and services rendered by me. For
example, to one King I pointed out the
means by which he was able to repossess
himself of the Apples of Youth; to another, I
showed the secret of re-opening the spring
whence flows the water which gives health
and life."</p>

<p>"Apples of Youth! Water of Life!"
interrupted the King, addressing Plavacete.
"I will go in search of those treasures myself!
What happiness! After eating one of
those rejuvenating apples, I shall return
restored to youth! Then I will drink a few
drops of the water of immortality&mdash;and I
shall live for ever!"</p>

<p>Without delaying a moment, the King set
off in search of those two objects&mdash;and down
to the present day has never been heard of
again.</p>

<h3>M<sup>R</sup>. HAY.</h3></div>
</div>

<p>I have the most severe misgiving
about a crucial point
of this story; it involves an
announcement which may
cause the modern reader to
throw aside the narrative as
a preposterous absurdity. Ah! if I only had
to deal with the reader of the Dark Ages,
who would swallow anything! Absolute fear
incites me to keep this announcement to
myself until nearing the end of the tale, and
then to break the awkward fact very gently&mdash;glossing
it over as much as possible; but
native outspokenness, assisted by the fact
that such a course would spoil the story,
persuades me to make the risky announcement
at once, and chance the consequences.</p>

<p>Very well, then&mdash;Andrew P. Hay was a
Centaur&mdash;a <span class="smcap">Centaur</span>. He had descended
from the pure blood of the old Greek Centaurs.
The race, when the belief in the
Greek mythology had waned before the
spreading light of Christianity, finding the
fact of its existence no longer accepted with
the old unquestioning faith, and too proud
to longer impose its presence on a society
sceptical of its reality, retired to a remote
island to carry on its existence unseen by
mankind; and there its successive generations
had appeared and died, until&mdash;a few
years before the present date&mdash;the last
survivor paced, with downcast hoof,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
deserted paddocks of his sires.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "Downcast hoof," though an unusual, is a good phrase.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "Sires" is a well-chosen word in this connection.</p></div>

<p>The loneliness of his condition began to
prey upon his mind. He had but a single
companion in the secluded upland valleys of
that deserted island where his forefathers
had lived during so many centuries; this
companion was his servant, or valet&mdash;he also
being the sole survivor of <i>his</i> race, the race
of hippopaides, or stable boys; from time
immemorial the bondmen of the Centaurs
and their faithful attendants.</p>

<p>The loneliness was becoming unbearable:
concealed behind some crag of the mountains,
the two would stand the whole day long
watching for the smoke of the steamers which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>passed, hull down, to and from Constantinople
and Smyrna. No vessel ever touched
at their island.</p>

<p>"Raiboskeles," said Philippos Chortophagos
(that was the Centaur's name, excusable
in a Greek), "this won't do! I can't stand
it any longer. Shall we hurl ourselves from
yonder pinnacle, you seated on my back, to
fathomless doom, and end it?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord!" said the boy, "I'm
scratched for that event anyway; and what's
more, <i>you</i> won't go to the post either if <i>I</i> can
stop it! Think, my lord&mdash;what would your
stable-companions, now passed away, have
said about a fixture like that?" And the
boy's eyes filled with tears as he mechanically
took from his pocket a small curry-comb and
drew it caressingly over the silky hide, while
a low continuous hissing sound from between
his lips testified to the depth of his sorrow.</p>

<p>He was a good lad, tinged with the archaic
stable-slang of Thessaly, fostered by constant
reading of the <i>Rhodochroon Hen</i>, the
ancient sporting-paper of the Centaurs.</p>

<p>For a few moments Chortophagos gazed
fixedly out to sea; then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Raiboskeles, I cannot stay here. I shall
go mad in this solitude. Let us leave this
island and go among men.
I know what you are about
to say&mdash;they will not believe
in my existence. I shall be
forced to suffer the affront of
being looked upon as a figment
of superstition, of having
my impossibility cast in my
teeth&mdash;I wager that is what
is on your tongue?"</p>

<p>"No takers!" said the
boy, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I prefer even
that to the loneliness of this
place. Besides, I might perhaps
manage to conceal the
difference in my form from
those of men."</p>

<p>The stable-valet shook his
head doubtfully. "Too much
handicapped!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"I might adopt a false
name!" cried the Centaur,
with a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>The idea took the stable-valet
unawares. "Ah! there's
something in that tip!" he
said, half persuaded.</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;I'll find one at
once: and that'll break the
neck of the whole difficulty!
I have it&mdash;I'll call myself Hay&mdash;Andrew P.
Hay. See?&mdash;Hay retains enough of my
ancestral name; the Philip I'll retain as a
reminder of my duty toward my race; while
the Andrew will assert the manhood of part
of me&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," said Raiboskeles, reflecting, "I
think I'll befriend that dodge at commanding
prices." This <i>Rhodochroon Hen</i> phraseology
was oppressive at times; but his heart
was in the right place.</p>

<p>"Let us hail a steamer somehow," cried
the Centaur (whom we will henceforth call
Andrew P. Hay).</p>

<p>The valet stood for a moment plunged in
thought, smacking his bare leg with an olive-twig;
then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll have to travel as a gee. Half
a sec!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 518px;">
<img src="images/i_554.jpg" width="518" height="594" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE SLIPPED IT OVER THE HEAD OF HIS MASTER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>With incredible dexterity he plaited reeds
from an adjacent stream into the form of a
horse's head-and-neck cover; then respectfully
slipped it over the human head and
torso of his master. The part where the
horse's nose should have been he had packed
with grass: the head of Andrew P. Hay filled
up the crown; while his human body made a
fair show, beneath the covering, of being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
horse's neck. The breadth where the man's
shoulders came the valet subsequently explained
by stating that he had placed a collar of
osiers there to keep off the rub of the covering.
There seemed an indignity about it which Mr.
Hay found it hard to bear; but he got over it.</p>

<p>Then the valet made a great fire of dry
wood and grasses on a pinnacle; and the
great column of smoke attracted the attention
of a passing coaster, which bore down
on the island to find out the reason of it.
Bowes (that being the new name which Mr.
Hay had found for his stable-valet) stood on
the shore holding his charge with a halter of
twisted grasses. The captain was surprised,
but agreed to take them aboard, provided the
horse could swim to the vessel, which could
not get in: so Mr. Hay, with Bowes on his
back, promptly took to the water, and was
hoisted aboard in a sling from the davits.</p>

<p>"That's a very remarkable animal!" said
the Greek captain to Bowes. His dialect
was atrocious. Bowes could not understand
a word; but signs did just as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew P. Hay had decided to go to
London. He knew a fair amount of English;
for several years before a box from a wrecked
vessel had been cast ashore on the island,
and it had happened to contain some useful
books and papers&mdash;a text of Homer, interlined
with Mr. Gladstone's translation into
English, several Greek-English primers, a
Liddell and Scott's lexicon, some Ollendorffs,
a Lindley Murray, Webster's American
Dictionary, several issues of the <i>Times</i>, and a
rhyming dictionary. Thus had A. P. Hay
been enabled to learn the English language.</p>

<p>The journey to England was full of
unpleasantness. There were difficulties, too,
about meals; the Centaur having conceived
a growing distaste for hay and beans. The
coaster had landed them at Otranto, where
Bowes promptly engaged a private stable for
his master. But now occurred the first
difficulty&mdash;they had no money. The captain
of the coaster had yet to be paid.</p>

<p>But Bowes contrived to obtain, on credit,
a suit of clothes in place of his tunic of
woven grasses.</p>

<p>"There's only one way out of this, sir,"
said Bowes, after a spell of thought; "I
shall have to sell you!"</p>

<p>"I fail to catch your meaning," said Mr.
Hay, loftily pawing the ground. "Sell <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"That's it, sir; that's the only plan <i>I</i> can
back for a place. You ought to fetch a good
round sum, sir. Why, sir, look at you&mdash;there
you stand, 17.1, deep in the girth,
lovely clean houghs and pasterns, sir&mdash;look
at 'em yourself if you ain't satisfied&mdash;sound
wind, well planted, born flier, grand action.
Look at your pedigree, that's enough! No
vice&mdash;lady could hunt you, sir&mdash;oh, I'm not
saying it to flatter you, sir! As for selling
you&mdash;don't you see," said Bowes, placing his
finger to his nose, "that's just a bit of practice,
that's all. We shall have to sharp 'em.
Let me alone to see to that."</p>

<p>"Well, Bowes," said the master, "I have
every confidence in you, although I do not
quite grasp your plan. I must only request
that you will do no act calculated to lessen
our self-respect or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get us warned off the course?" said
Bowes. "Oh, that'll be all square."</p>

<p>"But you forget that no one will buy me
without seeing my head! If I show that, all
is lost!"</p>

<p>Bowes merely winked, and went out.
Otranto was a most unpromising place for
selling a fine horse; but Bowes made inquiries,
and discovered that a rich Englishman,
much given to horses&mdash;a gentleman-jockey&mdash;whose
yacht was cruising in those
parts, happened to be in the town. So Bowes
fetched out Mr. Hay, mounted him, and
caracoled him all over the place where a
horse could manage to go; and presently he
caught the eye of the gentleman-jockey. The
latter had never seen such a picture of a horse
in his life, and yearned to own Mr. Hay.</p>

<p>Bowes explained that he wasn't for sale;
that, in fact, he was half sold already to an
American millionaire. (Bowes had picked
up a considerable smattering of English from
his master, you see.)</p>

<p>"Look here," said the gentleman-jockey,
"I must have him. On his back I could
win every steeplechase in the kingdom. I'll
give you &pound;1,000 for him."</p>

<p>"Down?" said Bowes.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other. "I'll put off to
my yacht and fetch it."</p>

<p>In an hour the &pound;1,000 in gold and
Italian paper was in Bowes's possession.
Bowes had explained how it would be unwise
to unwrap Mr. Hay's head and neck then,
as a cold wind was blowing, and the horse
had caught a slight cold on his voyage. The
jockey was so overcome by the magnificence
of the visible parts of Mr. Hay, and so convinced
of the wonderful bargain he had
made, that he was content to take the head
and neck for granted rather than let him go to
the American millionaire; so Mr. Hay was put
back in the stable for the night, and one of
the yacht's crew left there to see to his safety.</p>

<p>Shortly after dark Bowes picked the lock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
and crept in. Silently he placed a newly-acquired
saddle on Mr. Hay's back.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 508px;">
<img src="images/i_556.jpg" width="508" height="573" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I'LL GIVE YOU &pound;1,000 FOR HIM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"What now?" whispered Andrew P. Hay.</p>

<p>"We must be off at once and cover as
many miles as we can before daylight,"
whispered Bowes.</p>

<p>"But," objected Mr. Hay, "this is
immoral!"</p>

<p>All the refined morality of the ancient
Centaurs welled up in him.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" whispered Bowes. "Meaning
no offence, sir; but it's got to be done!"</p>

<p>At this moment the sailor woke and rose
to see what was going on. Now, gentleman
and man of honour as Mr. Hay was down to
the waist, the instinct of battle and self-preservation
in his equine portion instantly
gained the ascendency in those moments
when action was called for; and it was with
feelings of the most unfeigned horror and
regret that he felt himself backing toward
the unhappy sailor and taking up a favourable
position for an effective kick.</p>

<p>"Bowes!" he said, in an agony of apprehension.
"Quick! Don't you see what I'm
doing? For Heaven's sake give me a cut
over the quarters! Here&mdash;pull my head up,
so that I can't lash out!"</p>

<p>But it was too late; the
equine nature situated in
the hind-quarters had prevailed:
there was an end
of the sailor: Andrew P.
Hay hid his face in his
hands with a bitter sob,
and suffered himself to be
led out and mounted in
silence.</p>

<p>"You won't mind my presumption
in wearing spurs,
sir?" he said, apologetically.
"We might want 'em when
you get tired."</p>

<p>Andrew P. Hay hardly
heard the remark; his
thoughts were absorbed by
the regrettable incident of
the sailor; at a touch of
the spur he broke mechanically
into a gallop, which he
continued unbrokenly far
into the night. Suddenly he
pulled up.</p>

<p>"Bowes," he said, "I'm
famishing &mdash;&mdash;. I <i>must</i> have a
meal; I've eaten nothing
since the day before yesterday!"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," replied
Bowes, as he prepared to strap on a nose-bag
filled with chaff and locust beans; "you
shall have a bran-mash as soon as ever we
reach&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take away this stuff!" said Mr. Hay,
impatiently. "Do you hear? I've taken a
dislike to hay and beans and bran-mashes;
they're undignified food for a gentleman to
eat, and I've done with them. I want a
biftek aux pommes frites!"</p>

<p>"Can't get it here, sir," said Bowes, touching
his cap. "Oh; why, I've got some sandwiches
and a bottle of Marsala in the bag.
But, if I may make so bold, the beans would
have more stay in 'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the equine portion, no doubt. Confound
my equine portion, Bowes! It's in disgrace;
I'm disgusted with it, and I'll starve it!"</p>

<p>"Let's wait till we get home, sir, for that&mdash;if
I might make bold to advise. It's just the
hossey parts you require on the road."</p>

<p>"Hum! there's something in that," said
Mr. Hay; "well, give me the disgusting
nose-bag; and when I've finished the confounded
beans I will have a sandwich and a
glass of Marsala to remove the taste....
This Marsala is a coarse wine, Bowes; was
this the best thing you could get?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p>They set off again at a gallop; and Mr.
Hay soon perceived the wisdom of having
temporarily refreshed his horse-part. But his
aversion of, and anger against, it grew
steadily. As he galloped he continued to
brood upon the unjustifiable deed it had so
lately committed; and he speculated with an
oppressing anxiety on the acts it might commit
in the future; realizing, as he did, that
he had no control over that portion of him.</p>

<p>In spite of mountains, and the necessity
for occasional rest, they reached Naples in
two days. Here Bowes, having changed to
a new and horsey suit of clothes, and provided
Mr. Hay with new and handsome
horse-clothing (so that they were unrecognisable),
engaged a horse-box to Calais.</p>

<p>No mere horse could have covered the
distance in the time; so they had eluded
pursuit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They reached London at last, and Bowes
took a secluded villa, with stable, in St.
John's Wood. The stable was merely a
necessary artifice. With a sigh of relief
Andrew P. Hay threw himself down on the
hearthrug in the drawing-room; but the
bitterness of association with that hateful
horse-part was always with him. His dislike
of it had grown to a positive loathing. His
conduct when that part of him was in question
was really most unreasonable. He
would snatch up Bowes's riding-whip&mdash;the
poker&mdash;anything, and belabour that horse-portion
until it lashed out at the tables and
chairs and smashed them to atoms. These
scenes were most painful to Bowes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 562px;">
<img src="images/i_557.jpg" width="562" height="359" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"LASHED OUT AT THE TABLES AND CHAIRS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Andrew P. Hay was possessed of remarkable
aptitude, and, as the &pound;1,000 so fraudulently
acquired by Bowes was fast running
out, it became necessary to cast about for
employment. Now, his knowledge of the
archaic Greek tongue, history, and antiquities,
gained from direct tradition, was considerable;
and he wrote to the authorities of
the British Museum, the Society of Antiquaries,
the Kernoozers' Club, and various
other learned bodies, offering himself as
correspondent and referee at a reasonable
salary.</p>

<p>After some correspondence his services
were eagerly accepted; and for a time all
worked well. Dr. Schliemann considered
him invaluable, and much light was thrown
upon the question of early Greek inscriptions,
and the true site of Troy, and of the Garden
of the Hesperides; while much interesting
tittle-tattle, from authentic sources, added to
the knowledge of the private character and
daily life of Ajax, Achilles, the Muses,
Hercules, and others. All this had been
communicated by letter; but one calamitous
day a learned official from the British
Museum called, and, before it could be
prevented, had penetrated to the presence of
Mr. Hay.</p>

<p>The meeting was most painful. Mr. Hay,
attired in a loose morning coat and white
waistcoat, was writing a paper on the differences
between the Sapphic and Pindaric
harps; while his equine part was fraying out
the carpet with its hoofs and flicking away
flies with its tail. Mr. Hay made a desperate
effort to conceal the equine portion with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
tails of his coat, but in vain. The official
was deeply shocked and pained.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a&mdash;ahem! A Centaur, I believe?"
he gasped.</p>

<p>Prevarication was useless. Andrew P.
Hay bowed stiffly, and motioned the visitor
to a chair.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I must confess that I&mdash;er&mdash;hardly
anticipated this&mdash;er &mdash;&mdash;. I was under the
impression that we had been dealing with
an ordinary human being if you'll excuse
my saying so: but, forgive me&mdash;I fear the
authorities to whom I am answerable will
hardly approve of my obtaining information
from a&mdash;er&mdash;a fabulous monster."</p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>, sir?" cried A. P. Hay: and he
felt that equine part beginning to edge round
for a kick, while his ears were lying back close
to his head&mdash;the only equine idiosyncrasy
of his human part; but one which distressed
him greatly. He shouted for Bowes to
catch hold of his head; he seized the poker
and hammered at his flanks; but all in vain&mdash;those
terrible hind-legs lashed out: and the
official of the British Museum was no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a terrible affair: everything came
out. Poor Mr. Hay was arrested and taken
to Bow Street, where he was locked up in
the green-yard stables.</p>

<p>The horse-part resisted violently, nearly
killing three policemen, and attempting to
gallop off; while Mr. Hay begged them to
throw him and sit on his head, and subsequently
apologized most sincerely.</p>

<p>The gaoler was very considerate, giving him
his choice of oats or the usual fare.</p>

<p>The magistrate was greatly surprised; but,
of course, sent the case for trial. At the trial,
although the facts were clearly proved, the
jury were divided, some bringing in a verdict
of deliberate murder against Andrew Philip
Hay; some considering him not guilty, but
recommending the destruction of the horse-portion
as a dangerous animal. The judge,
animadverting in the severest terms on the
conduct of the prisoner, declared that,
although the jury had not been able to
agree as to a verdict, society could not
exonerate the perpetrator of such a deed; and
exhorted the prisoner to reflect deeply upon
his conduct, and make such atonement as
remorse and contrition would suggest.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to comment upon the
injudiciousness of the prisoner, who (although
apparently guiltless of any desire to sacrifice
human life) was, nevertheless, greatly to
blame for his recklessness in keeping so
dangerous an animal.</p>

<p>His Lordship asked whether prisoner
would consent to have the animal destroyed.
Prisoner was understood to reply that that
was impossible for physical reasons which
none could regret more deeply than himself.</p>

<p>Great excitement was created at this point
by prisoner kicking out the back and sides of
the dock, and hurling the usher into the
gallery; prisoner, however, having apologized
and expressed his belief that the incident had
been occasioned by a horsefly, the matter
was allowed to drop.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"KICKING THE USHER INTO THE GALLERY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The judge, having
retired for an hour to
consider his action in
the matter, stated that
he considered it his
duty, while severely deploring
the murderous
proclivities of the
prisoner and regretting
that the disagreement of
the jury prevented him
passing the capital sentence,
to exonerate the
accused from any intention
to permit the animal
to do grievous bodily
harm, and recommended
the keeping of it under
proper surveillance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span></p>

<p>Prisoner having undertaken to lash his
equine-part within an inch of its life, his
lordship remarked that he could not sanction
any proceedings involving cruelty to
the lower animals. Prisoner was then discharged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Andrew P. Hay was plunged in profound
misery. The disgrace and exposure of the
whole proceedings, the degradation of his
self-respect, cast over him a hopeless gloom.
For hours he sat on his haunches, his face
hidden in his hands, while scalding tears
trickled between his fingers: then he suddenly
arose, and kicked the villa to fragments.</p>

<p>At length his calmness returned, and he
sat down to think the thing out. The
exposure had come&mdash;why should he not turn
it to good account?</p>

<p>"Bowes!" he called. Poor
Bowes dragged his bruised
remains from among the
ruined brickwork.</p>

<p>"Bowes, my pride has
gone. I intend to make a
fortune by lecturing all over
the country about Greek antiquities, and my
recent trial. Pack my portmanteau, and then
go round and engage halls."</p>

<p>The lectures created a <i>furore</i>. The public
did not care two straws about Greek antiquities;
but they crushed to hear a real live
Centaur lecture about a murder case. At the
end of a year he had amassed wealth B.D.A.</p>

<p>Andrew Philip, Lord Hippstable, Baron
Hay, is now one of the best known and most
highly respected&mdash;er&mdash;men in society. He
was lately presented with a massive service
of plate by the Meltonshire Hunt, in
acknowledgment of his valued services as
master of the hounds; he is the most famous
steeplechase&mdash;ah&mdash;rider of the day; and the
last five Derby winners have hailed from his
stable&mdash;in fact, he entered for one Derby
himself, but was disqualified on purely technical
grounds; and there is
some talk in well-informed
circles of his probable succession
to the posts of President
of the Jockey Club and Equerry
to the Prince of Wales.</p>
